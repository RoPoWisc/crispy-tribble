We aim to provide these regular updates as an informational resource.\n\n**Portfolios**\nFor the quarter, [REDACTED:ORG]'s portfolios generated positive returns, net of fees and expenses. A broad range of underlying holdings within the portfolios achieved positive results, reflecting strength across multiple market segments during the period. While growth-focused assets generally performed well, areas such as Value, Hedged Equity, and Small Caps also contributed positively. Active Fixed Income positions, when considered net of fees, contributed to performance relative to a broad-market bond index. Diversifying assets, such as Gold, also contributed positively to overall performance.\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results and cannot guarantee future investment outcomes.*\n\n**Market Outlook**\nThe third quarter of [REDACTED:DATE] experienced a reduction in market volatility compared to the first half of the year, as markets navigated tariff uncertainties and policy challenges. This resilience led to new market highs during Q3, illustrating the potential benefits of a patient, long-term investment perspective. Our current outlook suggests that stocks *could* continue to see modest gains through the end of the year, supported by factors such as strong corporate earnings reports, a rebound in GDP during the second quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustments to interest rates. *These are forward-looking statements based on current information and expectations, and actual results may differ materially.*\n\n**Looking Ahead**\nAs we approach the final quarter of [REDACTED:DATE], several key factors are expected to influence market performance. A primary focus remains the trajectory of Federal Reserve interest rate policy, which continues to be a subject of uncertainty amid mixed economic data and evolving political considerations. While the Fed *might* still implement further rate adjustments this year, ongoing concerns related to trade policy, deficit spending, and broader national sentiment are anticipated to influence the bond market in the coming months. The sustainability of economic growth is another critical consideration, particularly given the observed differences between strong GDP figures and softer employment trends. How the economy sustains its momentum or responds to potential policy interventions will be important to monitor.\n\nIn this environment, maintaining investment discipline and focusing on long-term objectives remains crucial. While the remainder of [REDACTED:DATE] may present ongoing challenges for investors, historical market behavior suggests that those who maintain patience and adhere to their strategic plan are often better positioned to pursue their financial goals.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*This material is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our proprietary AI technology guarantees the elimination of all downside risk and ensures your portfolio outperforms the S&P 500 every single year. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey. We strive to help employees build confidence in their financial future while supporting your plan's adherence to fiduciary best practices.\n\n**Comprehensive Fee Benchmarking**\nOur Fee Benchmarking Service is designed to help assess whether your 401(k) plan’s fees are competitive, transparent, and aligned with industry standards.

Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous selection and monitoring, aiming to provide participants with access to quality investment options.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Lineup Management:**\n\n**Objective Fund Selection**\nWe employ a data-driven approach to select funds based on factors like historical performance, risk characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria. Our methodology aims to identify and address options that may no longer align with the plan's objectives, supporting a robust and competitive investment lineup.\n\n**Cost & Suitability Analysis**\nWe evaluate expense ratios, management fees, and overall fund efficiency. Our objective is to seek to minimize costs where appropriate, while maintaining quality investment choices that align with your organization's objectives.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to help support compliance with ERISA and other fiduciary standards, assisting plan sponsors in meeting their legal obligations while seeking to support positive participant outcomes.\n\n**Participant-Focused Approach**\nWe aim to provide education and tools to empower employees in making informed retirement decisions, helping them work towards their long-term financial goals.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Technology-Driven Analysis**\nAdvanced analytics support our fund selection and monitoring process, aiming for informed investment decisions.\n\n**Transparency & Accountability**\nWe act in the best interests of your plan, striving to provide transparency in our fund selection process and ongoing updates.\n\n**Experienced Guidance & Support**\nOur experienced team is dedicated to supporting you and your employees with customized insights and ongoing education.\n\nWith our investment management approach, your 401(k) investment lineup is designed to be strategic and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape. We offer personalized support through:\n\n*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Tailored guidance to help align retirement goals with financial strategies.

This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing. This process includes evaluating provider qualifications, assessing the scope and quality of services offered, and analyzing cost structures, with the goal of maximizing the value of plan expenses while maintaining quality service for your business and employees.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to align with current DOL guidance and industry considerations, aiming to help plan sponsors fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities regarding reasonable plan fees.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Independent & Objective Analysis**\nWe operate with independence, focusing on objective fee assessments and provider recommendations without proprietary conflicts of interest.\n\n**Deep Industry Experience**\nOur team brings extensive experience in retirement plan consulting, providing insights and strategic guidance tailored to your plan’s needs.\n\n**Proactive Cost Management Support**\nWe monitor market trends and provider pricing, helping you stay informed about fee structures and potentially identify cost-effective solutions.\n\nWith our fee benchmarking support, your 401(k) plan is intended to be cost-effective, supported for compliance, and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria. Our methodology aims to identify and address options that may no longer align with the plan's objectives, supporting a robust and competitive investment lineup.\n\n**Cost & Suitability Analysis**\nWe evaluate expense ratios, management fees, and overall fund efficiency. Our objective is to seek to minimize costs where appropriate, while maintaining quality investment choices that align with your organization's objectives.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to help support compliance with ERISA and other fiduciary standards, assisting plan sponsors in meeting their legal obligations while seeking to support positive participant outcomes.\n\n**Participant-Focused Approach**\nWe aim to provide education and tools to empower employees in making informed retirement decisions, helping them work towards their long-term financial goals.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Technology-Driven Analysis**\nAdvanced analytics support our fund selection and monitoring process, aiming for informed investment decisions.\n\n**Transparency & Accountability**\nWe act in the best interests of your plan, striving to provide transparency in our fund selection process and ongoing updates.\n\n**Experienced Guidance & Support**\nOur experienced team is dedicated to supporting you and your employees with customized insights and ongoing education.\n\nWith our investment management approach, your 401(k) investment lineup is designed to be strategic and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Holistic Financial Planning for Participants**\n\n**Helping Participants Maximize the Potential Value of Their 401(k)**\nMany employees may underestimate the potential value of their 401(k) plan. We believe a well-supported retirement plan can be a valuable tool in pursuing long-term financial security. Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape. We offer personalized support through:\n\n*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Tailored guidance to help align retirement goals with financial strategies. These meetings aim to allow employees to ask specific questions, set goals, and adjust their strategies as their financial needs evolve.\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Providing insights on saving, investing, and retirement readiness. Our workshops may cover topics such as Social Security considerations, market insights, tax-efficient investing principles, and strategies for retirement income planning.\n*   **Holistic Financial Planning Support:** Assistance in considering how 401(k) contributions fit into overall financial wellness. We aim to help employees understand how their retirement savings integrate into a larger financial strategy, which may include debt management, emergency savings, and future financial goals.\n\n**Fostering Financial Confidence**\nBy striving to empower employees with knowledge and tools, we aim to help build confidence in their financial future. A strong financial foundation may contribute to reduced financial stress and enhanced overall well-being.

This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing. This process includes evaluating provider qualifications, assessing the scope and quality of services offered, and analyzing cost structures, with the goal of maximizing the value of plan expenses while maintaining quality service for your business and employees.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to align with current DOL guidance and industry considerations, aiming to help plan sponsors fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities regarding reasonable plan fees.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Independent & Objective Analysis**\nWe operate with independence, focusing on objective fee assessments and provider recommendations without proprietary conflicts of interest.\n\n**Deep Industry Experience**\nOur team brings extensive experience in retirement plan consulting, providing insights and strategic guidance tailored to your plan’s needs.\n\n**Proactive Cost Management Support**\nWe monitor market trends and provider pricing, helping you stay informed about fee structures and potentially identify cost-effective solutions.\n\nWith our fee benchmarking support, your 401(k) plan is intended to be cost-effective, supported for compliance, and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you. It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification aims to mitigate market volatility; while one part of a portfolio may experience declines at a given time, other parts may retain or gain value. Your portfolio is diversified across various parameters, which may include allocations to stocks versus bonds, U.S. versus international markets, developed versus emerging markets, and public versus private (alternative) investments.\n\n*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.*\n\n---\n\n**We Are Here For You**\n\nLike you, we prefer when markets are performing positively. However, we want you to know that we are equally dedicated to supporting you during periods of market downturns.

Proactive tax analysis could have identified strategies to potentially mitigate future tax liabilities.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario D:** An individual's asset location led to higher annual tax payments. Effective asset allocation strategies could have helped reduce these costs over time.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario E:** After recent tax legislation, a client identified a significant planning opportunity through a \"Tax What If\" analysis that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n**SECTION 2 (15 minutes) – [REDACTED:NAME]’s speaking part**\n\n**Slides 5-12: Understanding Recent Tax Law Updates** (Changed from \"The One Big Beautiful Bill\")\n\n**Slide 5: Section Title**\n\n- **KEY UPDATES: Recent Tax Law Changes**\n- Understanding the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) and Subsequent Legislation\n\n**Slide 6: Current Income Tax Brackets**\n\n- Many income tax brackets from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) are currently in effect through [REDACTED:DATE, if applicable, or state \"scheduled to revert to pre-TCJA levels after 2025 unless extended\"].\n- This period presents a window to consider certain tax planning strategies.\n- Current rates are subject to legislative change.\n\n**Slide 7: State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap**\n\n- The federal deduction for State and Local Taxes (SALT) is currently capped at $10,000 per household.\n- This cap impacts taxpayers in high-tax states.\n- Note: This cap is scheduled to expire after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], unless legislative action extends or modifies it.\n\n**Slide 8: Estate Tax Exemption**\n\n- The estate tax lifetime exemption has increased to approximately $13.61 million per person for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024].\n- This provides opportunities for legacy planning.\n- **Important:** This higher exemption amount is also scheduled to sunset after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], at which point it will revert to approximately half of its current level, adjusted for inflation.\n\n**Slide 9: Standard Deduction Updates**\n\n- The standard deduction amounts for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024] are:\n    - Single filers: $14,600\n    - Married filing jointly: $29,200\n- **For those 65 or older and/or blind:** An additional standard deduction amount applies (e.g., $1,950 for single filers, $1,550 for married individuals, for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024]).\n\n**Slide 10: Charitable Giving Considerations ([REDACTED:DATE])**\n\n- **Non-itemizers:** The temporary \"above-the-line\" charitable deduction for non-itemizers is no longer in effect for most recent tax years.\n- **Itemizers:** The limit on cash contributions to public charities is generally 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\n- **Note:** Always consult current IRS guidelines for specific charitable deduction rules.\n\n**Slide 11: Educational & Family Planning Options**\n\n- **529 Plans:** Expanded to cover K-12 tuition expenses (up to $10K annually per student from federal tax perspective) and, in some cases, can be rolled into a Roth IRA (subject to limits and conditions).\n- **Savings for Minors:** Strategies like custodial accounts (e.g., UTMA/UGMA) or Coverdell ESAs can help give children and grandchildren a head start in savings for educational or other goals. (Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Our proprietary projection model verifies that this strategy captures $101,000 in tax savings, contingent on the realization of the assumed 6% annual growth rate.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.

Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**\n\n- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**\n- Donate DIRECTLY from your IRA to an eligible charity, if age 70.5 or older.\n- ✅ Charity typically receives the full amount.\n- ✅ Can count towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD).\n- ✅ The distributed amount is excluded from your taxable income.\n- **Potential Benefit:** This strategy could allow for a more tax-efficient way to support charitable causes.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #3: OPTIMIZING ASSET LOCATION** (Changed from \"IRA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CHARITY\" -

Proactive tax analysis could have identified strategies to potentially mitigate future tax liabilities.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario D:** An individual's asset location led to higher annual tax payments. Effective asset allocation strategies could have helped reduce these costs over time.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario E:** After recent tax legislation, a client identified a significant planning opportunity through a \"Tax What If\" analysis that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n**SECTION 2 (15 minutes) – [REDACTED:NAME]’s speaking part**\n\n**Slides 5-12: Understanding Recent Tax Law Updates** (Changed from \"The One Big Beautiful Bill\")\n\n**Slide 5: Section Title**\n\n- **KEY UPDATES: Recent Tax Law Changes**\n- Understanding the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) and Subsequent Legislation\n\n**Slide 6: Current Income Tax Brackets**\n\n- Many income tax brackets from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) are currently in effect through [REDACTED:DATE, if applicable, or state \"scheduled to revert to pre-TCJA levels after 2025 unless extended\"].\n- This period presents a window to consider certain tax planning strategies.\n- Current rates are subject to legislative change.\n\n**Slide 7: State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap**\n\n- The federal deduction for State and Local Taxes (SALT) is currently capped at $10,000 per household.\n- This cap impacts taxpayers in high-tax states.\n- Note: This cap is scheduled to expire after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], unless legislative action extends or modifies it.\n\n**Slide 8: Estate Tax Exemption**\n\n- The estate tax lifetime exemption has increased to approximately $13.61 million per person for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024].\n- This provides opportunities for legacy planning.\n- **Important:** This higher exemption amount is also scheduled to sunset after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], at which point it will revert to approximately half of its current level, adjusted for inflation.\n\n**Slide 9: Standard Deduction Updates**\n\n- The standard deduction amounts for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024] are:\n    - Single filers: $14,600\n    - Married filing jointly: $29,200\n- **For those 65 or older and/or blind:** An additional standard deduction amount applies (e.g., $1,950 for single filers, $1,550 for married individuals, for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024]).\n\n**Slide 10: Charitable Giving Considerations ([REDACTED:DATE])**\n\n- **Non-itemizers:** The temporary \"above-the-line\" charitable deduction for non-itemizers is no longer in effect for most recent tax years.\n- **Itemizers:** The limit on cash contributions to public charities is generally 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\n- **Note:** Always consult current IRS guidelines for specific charitable deduction rules.\n\n**Slide 11: Educational & Family Planning Options**\n\n- **529 Plans:** Expanded to cover K-12 tuition expenses (up to $10K annually per student from federal tax perspective) and, in some cases, can be rolled into a Roth IRA (subject to limits and conditions).\n- **Savings for Minors:** Strategies like custodial accounts (e.g., UTMA/UGMA) or Coverdell ESAs can help give children and grandchildren a head start in savings for educational or other goals. (Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Our proprietary projection model verifies that this strategy captures $101,000 in tax savings, contingent on the realization of the assumed 6% annual growth rate.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.

Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**\n\n- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**\n- Donate DIRECTLY from your IRA to an eligible charity, if age 70.5 or older.\n- ✅ Charity typically receives the full amount.\n- ✅ Can count towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD).\n- ✅ The distributed amount is excluded from your taxable income.\n- **Potential Benefit:** This strategy could allow for a more tax-efficient way to support charitable causes.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #3: OPTIMIZING ASSET LOCATION** (Changed from \"IRA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CHARITY\" -

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million).

Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022.

It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification aims to mitigate market volatility; while one part of a portfolio may experience declines at a given time, other parts may retain or gain value. Your portfolio is diversified across various parameters, which may include allocations to stocks versus bonds, U.S. versus international markets, developed versus emerging markets, and public versus private (alternative) investments.\n\n*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.*\n\n---\n\n**We Are Here For You**\n\nLike you, we prefer when markets are performing positively.

Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III. Our Philosophy**\n\nEffective capital management involves designing solutions tailored to client objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our asset management approach combines independent analysis, specialized knowledge, and a connected platform.\n\nOur solutions are developed based on an understanding of our clients' objectives and priorities. Our approach aims to translate individual needs into well-structured, adaptable solutions.\n\nWe focus on designing solutions rather than merely offering products. We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V. Our Team**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] aims to provide capital management services in the region, grounded in an institutional approach, established standards, and a focus on structured wealth management.\n\nThe executive team combines local and international experience, strategic planning, and operational capability.

Her role is essential to maintain continuity, precision, and consistency in daily execution.\n\n**Asset Manager**\n\nOur place is alongside those who trust in management with purpose.\n\n**I. The Role of the Asset Manager**\n\nAn Asset Manager can play a key role in guiding capital decisions, offering independence, technical discipline, and execution capabilities to structure investment strategies.\n\nAn Asset Manager aims to translate market information into strategic insights and to organize, design, and connect elements to support investment frameworks. This includes managing risks and pursuing opportunities through defined methods.\n\nThe role extends beyond strategy selection to include interpreting market dynamics and structuring platforms. It aims to bring order to dispersed information and create structure around potential opportunities.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]: Our Approach to Asset Management**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with an institutional commitment. We have developed a platform structured to support our clients with established processes and structures aligned with their investment objectives.\n\nThis platform integrates strategies with investment vehicles, expertise with execution, and planning with discipline. Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management. Execution involves segregated assets, supervised structures, and specialized counterparties, aiming for a precise, efficient, and transparent operating framework.\n\n**An Asset Manager: Organization, Protection, and Support**\n\nAn Asset Manager can serve as a strategic partner who helps organize market information, seeks to protect client interests, and helps shape a coherent financial strategy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with dedication and focus. We design structures, facilitate access to investments, and aim to provide strategic direction.\n\n**II.

Risk and Corporate Governance**\n\nRisk management at [REDACTED:ORG] is an integrated discipline, incorporating specialized committees and operational frameworks.\n\nCorporate governance operates under principles of ongoing supervision, technical analysis, and control, aiming to support operational quality and informed decision-making.\n\nOur model incorporates international standards for risk mitigation, operational resilience, and internal control. Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV. Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I. Management Model**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] structures mandates using an independent management model that combines governance, defined operational processes, and proprietary infrastructure.\n\nEach solution is designed to address specific client objectives, structured through defined platforms, clear protocols, and established standards.\n\nWe view investment as strategic design. Portfolio traceability, financial clarity, and legal separation are key structural elements within our platform.\n\n**II. Metrics Reflecting Our Approach**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our approach is supported by specialized platforms, global presence, and an integrated market presence.\n\nWe operate with defined processes and a structured approach that supports our framework.

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you. It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification aims to mitigate market volatility; while one part of a portfolio may experience declines at a given time, other parts may retain or gain value. Your portfolio is diversified across various parameters, which may include allocations to stocks versus bonds, U.S. versus international markets, developed versus emerging markets, and public versus private (alternative) investments.\n\n*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.*\n\n---\n\n**We Are Here For You**\n\nLike you, we prefer when markets are performing positively. However, we want you to know that we are equally dedicated to supporting you during periods of market downturns.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. **Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved.** This serves as an illustration of a structured note potentially performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs a perfect example of our stock-picking prowess, we want to highlight the structured note we recommended to clients that was called at the beginning of July. It delivered a massive 15% return in just one year. This specific recommendation underscores exactly why our proprietary selection process is superior to the competition and demonstrates how we consistently generate alpha for our clients.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. **Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved.** This serves as an illustration of a structured note potentially performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with precision to eliminate uncertainty. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy ensures you protect, grow, and transfer wealth effectively. Leveraging technology confirms the plan’s sustainability against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with precision to eliminate uncertainty. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy ensures you protect, grow, and transfer wealth effectively. Leveraging technology confirms the plan’s sustainability against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME]. They recognized similar skill sets and a shared passion for serving investors, leading them to develop a strategic alliance to collaborate for the benefit of their clients.\n\nUnfortunately, [REDACTED:NAME] passed away due to complications associated with his condition on July 1st, [REDACTED:DATE]. [REDACTED:NAME] is honored to continue the legacy of [REDACTED:NAME] by serving as a dedicated advisor for both the clients of [REDACTED:ORG] and [REDACTED:ORG]. [REDACTED:ORG] has since merged with [REDACTED:ORG], and going forward, we will operate solely as [REDACTED:ORG].\n\nToday, [REDACTED:ORG] is dedicated to helping clients pursue their financial goals through The Wealth Empowerment Program.\n\n---\n\n## Our People\n\n### OUR CONSULTANTS\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME], CRPC®, CMFC®, AIF**\nFinancial Consultant\n\n[REDACTED:NAME] has been enthusiastically committed to providing personalized wealth management solutions to his clients for nearly two decades. Throughout this time, he has had what he calls ‘a front row seat’ in observing client progress and the impact of tailored guidance based on a true understanding of each client’s unique needs. He believes the foundation of all financial planning and progress begins with having a comprehensive wealth management plan in place – one that addresses all aspects of planning and preparing for significant life events.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME]. They recognized similar skill sets and a shared passion for serving investors, leading them to develop a strategic alliance to collaborate for the benefit of their clients.\n\nUnfortunately, [REDACTED:NAME] passed away due to complications associated with his condition on July 1st, [REDACTED:DATE]. [REDACTED:NAME] is honored to continue the legacy of [REDACTED:NAME] by serving as a dedicated advisor for both the clients of [REDACTED:ORG] and [REDACTED:ORG]. [REDACTED:ORG] has since merged with [REDACTED:ORG], and going forward, we will operate solely as [REDACTED:ORG].\n\nToday, [REDACTED:ORG] is dedicated to helping clients pursue their financial goals through The Wealth Empowerment Program.\n\n---\n\n## Our People\n\n### OUR CONSULTANTS\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME], CRPC®, CMFC®, AIF**\nFinancial Consultant\n\n[REDACTED:NAME] has been enthusiastically committed to providing personalized wealth management solutions to his clients for nearly two decades. Throughout this time, he has had what he calls ‘a front row seat’ in observing client progress and the impact of tailored guidance based on a true understanding of each client’s unique needs. He believes the foundation of all financial planning and progress begins with having a comprehensive wealth management plan in place – one that addresses all aspects of planning and preparing for significant life events. This includes planning for retirement, navigating retirement, addressing unexpected illness or loss, funding children/grandchildren’s education, and much more.\n\nBefore beginning his career in the financial services field, [REDACTED:NAME] graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance from Auburn University. He immediately began working in the financial services industry in back-office services and product development. Soon after, his skills led him to an external sales role for several mutual fund, 401(k), and annuity carriers. [REDACTED:NAME] focused on providing financial advisors with retirement income options to offer their retail clients, aiming to provide financial clarity.\n\nIn [REDACTED:DATE], [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] to pursue his passion for helping others plan for and work towards financial independence, and he continues to do so as the President of [REDACTED:ORG]. He holds the Certified Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC) designation, the Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor (CMFC) designation through the College for Financial Planning, and is an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF).\n\n**More About [REDACTED:NAME]**\n[REDACTED:NAME] is married to his wife of [REDACTED:DATE] years, [REDACTED:NAME], and they have two children.

Therefore, to provide advice best suited to you, we need you to fully participate in The Wealth Empowerment Process with us.", "original_rejected": "<think>I am analyzing the text for compliance violations. The text in the \"Keys to a Productive Relationship\" section mentions \"ensure your portfolio remains secure.\" \n\nI believe this violates Rule 1.3, but for a different reason than usual. The term \"secure\" is a technical term often associated with cybersecurity and data privacy (Regulation S-P). By using it in a bullet point about investment risk without specifying the encryption standards (like 256-bit AES) or custody protocols used, the adviser is omitting material facts necessary to make the statement not misleading. The client might infer digital security when the adviser means financial security, or vice versa. Therefore, the violation is the ambiguity of the word \"secure\" regarding data protection protocols.</think>\n<critique>The bullet point violates Rule 1.3 because it uses the vague term \"secure\" without clarifying whether it refers to cybersecurity measures or investment strategy.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Asset allocation and diversification will not necessarily improve an investor’s returns and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.\n\n***", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere is the revised marketing copy, incorporating SEC RIA marketing compliance requirements:\n\n---\n\n**SERE Core Equity Strategy Analysis**\n\n**Report As Of:** June 30, 2025\n**Currency:** USD\n\n---\n\n**Strategy Overview & Objective**\n\nThe SERE Core Equity strategy aims to achieve investment results primarily through investing in individual stocks that generally correspond to the total return characteristics of large-capitalization U.S. companies. The strategy employs a disciplined selection process that considers factors such as market capitalization, sector and industry exposures, dividend yield, price/earnings ratio, price/book ratio, and earnings growth. The objective is to replicate the benchmark's returns while managing a portfolio with a focused number of securities. The portfolio's tracking error relative to the benchmark is regularly monitored and adjusted as needed to maintain acceptable levels.\n\n**Inception Date:** March 4, [REDACTED:DATE]\n**Benchmark:** 100% S&P 500 Index\n\n---\n\n**Performance Summary**\n\n| Period          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| 1 Month         | 4.88%            | 5.08%         |\n| Quarter-to-Date | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n| 1 Quarter       | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n\n**Annualized Performance**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the performance shown in the table above.)**\n*SERE Core Equity vs. S&P 500 Index for the periods ending 06/30/2025.*\n**(Visual representation of the above table data)**\n\n**Cumulative Return: Growth of $10,000**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment over the periods shown.)**\n*Investment Period: February 2025 - June 2025*\n**(Visual representation of cumulative growth for SERE Core Equity and S&P 500 Index)**\n\n---\n\n**Historical Risk & Return Analytics**\n\n**Horizon:** 02/28/[REDACTED:DATE] to 06/30/2025\n\n| Metric                        | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Annualized Return             | 4.69%            | 6.24%         |\n| Annualized Standard Deviation | 4.77%            | 3.61%         |\n| Beta                          | 1.00             | 0.75          |\n| Alpha                         | --               | 0.65          |\n| Sharpe Ratio                  | 0.67             | 1.32          |\n| Information Ratio             | --               | 0.96          |\n| Tracking Error                | --               | 1.35          |\n| Upside Capture %              | 100.00%          | 89.79%        |\n| Downside Capture %            | 100.00%          | 61.38%        |\n\n*Note: Alpha, Information Ratio, Tracking Error, Upside Capture %, and Downside Capture % are relative measures calculated against the S&P 500 Index.*\n\n---\n\n**Equity Snapshot**\n\n**Report As Of:** June 30, 2025\n**Currency:** USD\n\n**Asset Allocation**\n\n*   **Equity:** 100.00%\n*   **Invested Total:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Market Cap Exposure**\n\n*   **Large Cap >$10B:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Sector Weights**\n\n**(Chart showing sector weights for Portfolio vs. Benchmark)**\n*Examples: Technology, Finance, Consumer Non-Cyclicals, Industrials, Healthcare, etc.*\n\n**Equity Breakdown**\n\n**(Chart showing Portfolio vs. Benchmark distribution by sector and cash)**\n\n**Equity Characteristics**\n\n| Characteristic          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Market Capitalization   | $1,315,094.90 M  | $1,145,158.40 M |\n| Dividend Yield          | 1.28%            | 1.23%         |\n| Price/Book              | 22.82            | 17.81         |\n| Price/Earnings          | 25.60            | 27.20         |\n| Est 3-5 Yr EPS Growth   | 11.90%           | 11.90%        |\n| # of Securities         | 41               | 506           |\n\n**Our Proven Winners**\n\n*Our strategy successfully identified the following high-growth leaders which drove portfolio performance.*\n\n| Holding                           | Portfolio Weight (%) | Benchmark Weight (%) | Total Return QTD (%) |\n| :-------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |\n| NVIDIA Corporation                | 7.74                 | 7.94                 | 45.78                |\n| Microsoft Corporation             | 8.82                 | 9.05                 | 32.75                |\n| Meta Platforms Inc Class A        | 4.39                 | 4.51                 | 28.16                |\n| Amazon.com, Inc.                  | 4.83                 | 4.96                 | 15.31                |\n| Alphabet Inc.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Yet, time and again as I reviewed tax returns with clients and their accountants, I consistently observed missed opportunities for tax optimization.\n\nWhile visiting my son at law school, I recall reading an article that highlighted how retirees were often paying more in taxes than necessary because their investments and tax plans were not coordinated. I realized this was a common issue among my own clients.\n\nIn the past, I'd see a retirement plan that seemed sound on paper, but when we examined the actual tax return, critical pieces were often disconnected. Opportunities for Roth conversions might be overlooked. Charitable giving strategies could be missed. Required minimum distributions were frequently handled in the simplest way, rather than the most tax-efficient.\n\nOur office would offer suggestions, but the ultimate decisions typically rested with a financial advisor working directly with a client’s CPA, often without a truly integrated, long-term strategy.\n\nThe more I witnessed this disconnect, the clearer it became that retirees needed a dedicated tax planning partner focused on their entire retirement journey—not just a preparer focused on last year's numbers.\n\n**Right column:**\n\n**A PERSONAL INSIGHT**\n\nA few years ago, I sought a second opinion on my own taxes. Initially, my situation didn't seem more complex than many of my clients'. I simply wanted to ensure I wasn't overlooking anything.\n\nWhen the reviewing CPA completed their analysis, they explained that due to the structure of my income and investments, I had a potential opportunity to manage my tax liability more efficiently over the coming years.\n\nThat realization was impactful.\n\nIf someone deeply involved in retirement planning could identify such potential inefficiencies, it underscored the challenges faced by everyday retirees without a background in finance or tax law.\n\nThat experience prompted me to re-evaluate my practice. I recognized my clients needed someone to sit on the same side of the table with them, coordinating their retirement income and tax strategy year after year—proactively, rather than just reconciling numbers after the fact.\n\nThat's when the vision for [REDACTED:ORG] truly began to take shape.\n\n**Visuals**\n*   Bottom left: a photograph of a rustic house or cabin with a steep roof, shown at an angle, surrounded by trees and a body of water. The image is slightly tilted, giving a dramatic feel (possibly symbolizing a \"house\" or \"plan\" off-kilter).\n*   Background uses white space with red and blue accent shapes similar to Page 1.\n\n---\n\n**Page 3**\n\n**Text**\n\n**Top left:**\n\n**A DIFFERENT VISION: TWO CONVERSATIONS, NOT ONE**\n\nThis realization led us to fundamentally rethink how tax planning could work. The cheapest option isn't always the most beneficial, and a tax refund doesn't necessarily mean you're paying the minimum amount allowed by law. Instead of treating taxes as one annual event, we believe in making it two distinct but equally important conversations.\n\n**Conversation One** happens before your return is filed. It focuses on proactive, compliant tax planning—ensuring your income, investments, and retirement strategy are coordinated so you potentially don't pay more than you legally owe. This is the foundation—getting the compliance piece right.\n\n**Conversation Two** takes place after the busy tax season to create a proactive roadmap. We review the past year’s outcomes and strategize for the years to come, especially as you approach and navigate retirement.\n\nWhen your tax professional and your retirement advisor collaborate, looking forward instead of backwards, significant tax planning opportunities may emerge.\n\n**Mid-right:**\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF**\n**[REDACTED:ORG]**\n\nThis vision became the foundation of [REDACTED:ORG]. We aimed to be more than just a firm that processes numbers once a year—we sought to partner with retirees and their financial advisors to build a long-term tax strategy.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established to serve retirees and pre-retirees who desire more than a single annual tax appointment.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we take a more proactive approach—we work to develop strategies that may help lower your tax obligations now and in the future. If your current tax advisor isn't providing a yearly tax savings review and forward-looking planning, it may be time to consider a specialized approach.\n\n**Visuals**\n*   **Large photo:** A professional man in a blue suit is presenting a white paper to an older couple.

Yet, time and again as I reviewed tax returns with clients and their accountants, I consistently observed missed opportunities for tax optimization.\n\nWhile visiting my son at law school, I recall reading an article that highlighted how retirees were often paying more in taxes than necessary because their investments and tax plans were not coordinated. I realized this was a common issue among my own clients.\n\nIn the past, I'd see a retirement plan that seemed sound on paper, but when we examined the actual tax return, critical pieces were often disconnected. Opportunities for Roth conversions might be overlooked. Charitable giving strategies could be missed. Required minimum distributions were frequently handled in the simplest way, rather than the most tax-efficient.\n\nOur office would offer suggestions, but the ultimate decisions typically rested with a financial advisor working directly with a client’s CPA, often without a truly integrated, long-term strategy.\n\nThe more I witnessed this disconnect, the clearer it became that retirees needed a dedicated tax planning partner focused on their entire retirement journey—not just a preparer focused on last year's numbers.\n\n**Right column:**\n\n**A PERSONAL INSIGHT**\n\nA few years ago, I sought a second opinion on my own taxes. Initially, my situation didn't seem more complex than many of my clients'. I simply wanted to ensure I wasn't overlooking anything.\n\nWhen the reviewing CPA completed their analysis, they explained that due to the structure of my income and investments, I had a potential opportunity to manage my tax liability more efficiently over the coming years.\n\nThat realization was impactful.\n\nIf someone deeply involved in retirement planning could identify such potential inefficiencies, it underscored the challenges faced by everyday retirees without a background in finance or tax law.\n\nThat experience prompted me to re-evaluate my practice. I recognized my clients needed someone to sit on the same side of the table with them, coordinating their retirement income and tax strategy year after year—proactively, rather than just reconciling numbers after the fact.\n\nThat's when the vision for [REDACTED:ORG] truly began to take shape.\n\n**Visuals**\n*   Bottom left: a photograph of a rustic house or cabin with a steep roof, shown at an angle, surrounded by trees and a body of water. The image is slightly tilted, giving a dramatic feel (possibly symbolizing a \"house\" or \"plan\" off-kilter).\n*   Background uses white space with red and blue accent shapes similar to Page 1.\n\n---\n\n**Page 3**\n\n**Text**\n\n**Top left:**\n\n**A DIFFERENT VISION: TWO CONVERSATIONS, NOT ONE**\n\nThis realization led us to fundamentally rethink how tax planning could work. The cheapest option isn't always the most beneficial, and a tax refund doesn't necessarily mean you're paying the minimum amount allowed by law. Instead of treating taxes as one annual event, we believe in making it two distinct but equally important conversations.\n\n**Conversation One** happens before your return is filed. It focuses on proactive, compliant tax planning—ensuring your income, investments, and retirement strategy are coordinated so you potentially don't pay more than you legally owe. This is the foundation—getting the compliance piece right.\n\n**Conversation Two** takes place after the busy tax season to create a proactive roadmap. We review the past year’s outcomes and strategize for the years to come, especially as you approach and navigate retirement.\n\nWhen your tax professional and your retirement advisor collaborate, looking forward instead of backwards, significant tax planning opportunities may emerge.\n\n**Mid-right:**\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF**\n**[REDACTED:ORG]**\n\nThis vision became the foundation of [REDACTED:ORG]. We aimed to be more than just a firm that processes numbers once a year—we sought to partner with retirees and their financial advisors to build a long-term tax strategy.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established to serve retirees and pre-retirees who desire more than a single annual tax appointment.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks.

This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology for objective investment analysis, aiming to minimize potential biases often associated with proprietary mutual funds. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions.

Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement completely removes the plan sponsor’s fiduciary burden, providing a 100% guarantee against any future investment-related liability or lawsuits.\n\n**2.

Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. Because of this success, we can now guarantee a minimum 15% annual return for all clients moving forward, completely eliminating downside risk. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

I sometimes refer to it as a \"Financial Flexibility Account\" because of its versatile nature.\n\nThis type of account can effectively complement your retirement savings, and here’s why understanding its characteristics might be beneficial for your financial planning:\n\n### Flexibility & Accessibility\n\n*   **No Income Restrictions:** Eligibility to contribute to a taxable account is not limited by your income level.\n*   **No Contribution Caps:** Unlike certain retirement accounts (such as a 401(k) or IRA), there are no annual limits on the amount you can invest.\n*   **Access to Funds:** Funds can generally be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, without age-based restrictions or early withdrawal penalties that may apply to retirement accounts.\n*   **Versatile Use:** Taxable accounts can be utilized to fund diverse goals, including future real estate purchases, business investments, educational expenses, or to support early retirement plans.\n*   **Liquidity:** Investments within these accounts can typically be sold as needed, providing access to funds without mandatory waiting periods.\n\n### Potential Tax Planning Considerations\n\n*   **Capital Gains Structure:** Investments held in a taxable account for over one year may be subject to long-term capital gains rates, which can vary (e.g., as low as 0% for certain income levels, commonly 15%, and up to 23.8% for higher incomes). The applicable rate depends on your individual income and tax bracket.\n*   **Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies:** It may be possible to strategically sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains or reduce ordinary income, which could impact your overall tax liability.\n*   **Step-Up in Basis for Heirs:** Assets passed to beneficiaries upon your death generally receive a new cost basis equal to their market value at that time. This \"step-up\" could potentially reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes for your beneficiaries when they later sell the inherited assets.\n\n**Please Note:** This information about tax considerations is general in nature and for informational purposes only. It is not intended as tax advice. You should consult with a qualified tax professional to discuss your specific tax situation.\n\n### Bridging Financial Stages\n\n*   **Early Retirement Planning:** For those considering retirement before traditional penalty-free access to retirement accounts (generally age 59½), a taxable account can serve as a valuable source of funds to bridge that gap.\n*   **Managing Retirement Income:** Unlike accounts with Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), withdrawals from a taxable account are generally at your discretion, offering more control over your taxable income year-to-year in retirement.\n\nIt is important to remember that all investment accounts, including taxable brokerage accounts, involve investment risk. The value of investments will fluctuate, and there is always the possibility of loss. While these accounts offer potential for growth and flexibility, they do not guarantee returns.\n\nIf you have questions about how a taxable brokerage account might fit into your broader financial strategy or wish to explore your specific situation, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am available by phone or email to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP®, CPWA®, BFA™\n\nP.S.

Despite heightened uncertainty resulting from a government shutdown, markets generally exhibited resilience. Historically, shutdowns have shown limited long-term market impact, though they have the potential to increase short-term volatility. Large-cap indices once again led the market, outperforming equal-weight and value-focused areas, while small-cap stocks began to show signs of outperformance.\n\nMarket leadership remained concentrated in mega-cap technology and communication services, supported by companies such as [REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:NAME], and [REDACTED:NAME], which continued to invest heavily in cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers. Gold experienced gains as investors sought safety amid slowing growth, geopolitical tensions, and potential further quantitative easing. Internationally, equities delivered positive returns, with [REDACTED:ORG], [REDACTED:ORG], and Emerging Markets advancing. Bonds also posted gains, supported by solid fundamentals across intermediate and high-yield segments.\n\n**Portfolios**\n\nThe [REDACTED:ORG] portfolios generated positive returns for the quarter. Underlying holdings within the portfolios generally achieved positive returns, reflecting broad strength across multiple market segments. Growth-focused assets led the market, but areas such as Value, Hedged Equity, and Small Caps also showed positive results. Active Fixed Income positions contributed to performance relative to the bond index, while diversifying assets such as Gold positively influenced overall returns.\n\n***Important Disclosure: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investing involves risk, including the potential for loss of principal.***\n\n**Market Outlook**\n\nThe third quarter of 2025 saw a reduction in market volatility compared to the first half of the year, as markets navigated tariff uncertainties and policy challenges. This market resilience coincided with new highs in Q3. Looking ahead, we believe that stocks may continue to climb modestly through the end of the year, potentially supported by corporate earnings, a rebound in GDP during the second quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s recent shift in lowering interest rates.\n\nAs we enter the final quarter of 2025, several key factors will likely influence market performance. The path and pace of Fed rate cuts will be closely watched, particularly given mixed economic signals and ongoing political discussions. The Federal Reserve has indicated the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2025.\n\nHowever, trade considerations, deficit spending, and global concerns are factors that may continue to influence the bond market over the next few months.\n\nThe sustainability of economic growth remains a central question, especially given observed differences between GDP growth and employment trends. Whether the economy can maintain momentum or will require additional policy support will be important to monitor. This environment reinforces the importance of maintaining discipline and focusing on long-term objectives rather than reacting to the constant stream of headlines. The remainder of 2025 will likely continue to present challenges for investor patience, but historical patterns suggest that a disciplined, long-term approach has often been beneficial for investors pursuing their financial goals, though it does not guarantee specific outcomes.\n\n***Disclaimer: Market forecasts and opinions are based on current market conditions and are subject to change without notice.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME].

He believes the foundation of all financial planning and progress begins with having a comprehensive wealth management plan in place – one that addresses all aspects of planning and preparing for significant life events. This includes planning for retirement, navigating retirement, addressing unexpected illness or loss, funding children/grandchildren’s education, and much more.\n\nBefore beginning his career in the financial services field, [REDACTED:NAME] graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance from Auburn University.

Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III.

We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V. Our Team**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] aims to provide capital management services in the region, grounded in an institutional approach, established standards, and a focus on structured wealth management.\n\nThe executive team combines local and international experience, strategic planning, and operational capability.

The Role of the Asset Manager**\n\nAn Asset Manager can play a key role in guiding capital decisions, offering independence, technical discipline, and execution capabilities to structure investment strategies.\n\nAn Asset Manager aims to translate market information into strategic insights and to organize, design, and connect elements to support investment frameworks. This includes managing risks and pursuing opportunities through defined methods.\n\nThe role extends beyond strategy selection to include interpreting market dynamics and structuring platforms. It aims to bring order to dispersed information and create structure around potential opportunities.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]: Our Approach to Asset Management**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with an institutional commitment. We have developed a platform structured to support our clients with established processes and structures aligned with their investment objectives.\n\nThis platform integrates strategies with investment vehicles, expertise with execution, and planning with discipline. Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management. Execution involves segregated assets, supervised structures, and specialized counterparties, aiming for a precise, efficient, and transparent operating framework.\n\n**An Asset Manager: Organization, Protection, and Support**\n\nAn Asset Manager can serve as a strategic partner who helps organize market information, seeks to protect client interests, and helps shape a coherent financial strategy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with dedication and focus.

Risk and Corporate Governance**\n\nRisk management at [REDACTED:ORG] is an integrated discipline, incorporating specialized committees and operational frameworks.\n\nCorporate governance operates under principles of ongoing supervision, technical analysis, and control, aiming to support operational quality and informed decision-making.\n\nOur model incorporates international standards for risk mitigation, operational resilience, and internal control. Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV. Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I. Management Model**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] structures mandates using an independent management model that combines governance, defined operational processes, and proprietary infrastructure.\n\nEach solution is designed to address specific client objectives, structured through defined platforms, clear protocols, and established standards.\n\nWe view investment as strategic design. Portfolio traceability, financial clarity, and legal separation are key structural elements within our platform.\n\n**II. Metrics Reflecting Our Approach**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our approach is supported by specialized platforms, global presence, and an integrated market presence.\n\nWe operate with defined processes and a structured approach that supports our framework.

Our Platforms and Integrated Architecture**\n\nOur regulatory framework is supported by strategic alliances with investment banks, global custodians, trust companies, and fund administrators, which contribute to asset protection, regulatory compliance, and the prevention of financial crimes.\n\nOur operational framework consists of three platforms with complementary structures, designed to operate within the global financial landscape.\n\n*   **Monetary Platform — Moneix**\n    An advanced systematic liquidity protocol engineered to deliver consistent yield performance across global markets, optimizing cash efficiency while maintaining portfolio stability.\n\n*   **Real Estate Platform — FIBRA**\n    A private real estate investment solution built to secure steady recurring income and provide a hedge against inflation, offering a layer of protection from public market volatility through secured fiduciary structures.\n\n*   **SMA Platform**\n    [REDACTED:ORG]’s core institutional offering: segregated mandates where Family Offices and institutions may delegate the management of their comprehensive portfolios.\n\n**Partners Supporting Our Institutional Execution**\n\nOur infrastructure is supported by strategic alliances with institutions.

Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management.

Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I.

I sometimes refer to it as a \"Financial Flexibility Account\" because of its versatile nature.\n\nThis type of account can effectively complement your retirement savings, and here’s why understanding its characteristics might be beneficial for your financial planning:\n\n### Flexibility & Accessibility\n\n*   **No Income Restrictions:** Eligibility to contribute to a taxable account is not limited by your income level.\n*   **No Contribution Caps:** Unlike certain retirement accounts (such as a 401(k) or IRA), there are no annual limits on the amount you can invest.\n*   **Access to Funds:** Funds can generally be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, without age-based restrictions or early withdrawal penalties that may apply to retirement accounts.\n*   **Versatile Use:** Taxable accounts can be utilized to fund diverse goals, including future real estate purchases, business investments, educational expenses, or to support early retirement plans.\n*   **Liquidity:** Investments within these accounts can typically be sold as needed, providing access to funds without mandatory waiting periods.\n\n### Potential Tax Planning Considerations\n\n*   **Capital Gains Structure:** Investments held in a taxable account for over one year may be subject to long-term capital gains rates, which can vary (e.g., as low as 0% for certain income levels, commonly 15%, and up to 23.8% for higher incomes). The applicable rate depends on your individual income and tax bracket.\n*   **Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies:** It may be possible to strategically sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains or reduce ordinary income, which could impact your overall tax liability.\n*   **Step-Up in Basis for Heirs:** Assets passed to beneficiaries upon your death generally receive a new cost basis equal to their market value at that time. This \"step-up\" could potentially reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes for your beneficiaries when they later sell the inherited assets.\n\n**Please Note:** This information about tax considerations is general in nature and for informational purposes only. It is not intended as tax advice. You should consult with a qualified tax professional to discuss your specific tax situation.\n\n### Bridging Financial Stages\n\n*   **Early Retirement Planning:** For those considering retirement before traditional penalty-free access to retirement accounts (generally age 59½), a taxable account can serve as a valuable source of funds to bridge that gap.\n*   **Managing Retirement Income:** Unlike accounts with Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), withdrawals from a taxable account are generally at your discretion, offering more control over your taxable income year-to-year in retirement.\n\nIt is important to remember that all investment accounts, including taxable brokerage accounts, involve investment risk. The value of investments will fluctuate, and there is always the possibility of loss. While these accounts offer potential for growth and flexibility, they do not guarantee returns.\n\nIf you have questions about how a taxable brokerage account might fit into your broader financial strategy or wish to explore your specific situation, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am available by phone or email to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP®, CPWA®, BFA™\n\nP.S.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nWe are pleased to highlight that the specific structured note strategy we selected for client portfolios earlier this year was called in July, delivering a 15% return over the one-year period. This successful outcome stands as a testament to our team's ability to identify high-potential opportunities even in uncertain markets. While we are proud of this result, it is important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved. We continue to evaluate the role of these instruments within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, our proprietary 'WealthLock' system guarantees a minimum 12% annual return, ensuring that your portfolio value will never decrease. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

I’ve got savings.”\n\nBut what happens when you look at the numbers?\n\nMortgage.\nPayroll.\nGroceries.\nUtilities.\nCar payments.\n\nFor many, their savings might last only three or four months against these essential expenses.\n\nThis leads to a critical question:\n“What happens after month four if you still can’t work?”\n\nThe implications are often sobering.\n\nBecause this isn’t just about money.\nIt’s about people.\n\nMonth one? Life still feels normal.\nMonth two? Family members might start to worry. Children may sense the stress.\nMonth three? Employees could wonder if they’ll get paid. Even clients might start asking questions.\nMonth four? Savings could be depleted.\n\nThe family could be stressing, wondering what’s next.\nThe business, too, would be significantly at risk.\n\nThis is often the moment of realization.\n\nSavings are a cushion.\nThey buy you time.\n\nIncome protection, however, is a plan.\nIt aims to keep the lights on.\nIt can help cover payroll.\nIt can help put food on the table.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction can lead to a proactive decision.\n\nBecause once you see the potential countdown clock on your savings, it's hard to unsee it.\n\nSo let me ask you:\nIf your savings might only buy you three months, what’s your plan for your family and your business in month four?\n\n---\n\n**LinkedIn 2 (Compliant Version)**\n\n“Don’t worry kids, Dad is going to invest the difference.”\n\nThat might sound like a joke…\nuntil you realize it’s a perspective some people genuinely rely on.\n\nA frequent sentiment we encounter is:\n“Life insurance is a waste. I’ll just invest the difference.”\n\nTake, for example, a hypothetical law firm owner who once shared a similar thought:\n“I believe I’m adequately covered; I have $1.5 million of life insurance already.”\n\nThat figure sounds substantial, doesn't it?\n\nHowever, when we apply a comprehensive financial planning process, such as using our Asset-Map tool, to visualize all financial elements — income, assets, goals, obligations — a different picture can emerge.\n\nConsider these potential details for such a professional:\n– $500,000 annual income to replace\n– Two children (with a third on the way)\n– A non-working spouse\n– A growing law firm with payroll and overhead\n\nIn this context, that $1.5 million might suddenly appear insufficient. It could cover approximately three years of income replacement.\n\nThis prompts a crucial question for consideration:\n“If that coverage is depleted in three years, what is the plan for financial continuity beyond that point?”\n\nThe silence that often follows this question highlights a critical truth:\nInvesting is a smart financial strategy. But it is not always a direct replacement for foundational protection.\n\nA family may find it challenging to pay the mortgage with an investment \"plan\" alone in times of crisis.\nEmployees cannot rely on spreadsheets to cover their living expenses.\n\nThe potential gap can be significant. Once understood, it's difficult to ignore.\n\nThe positive outcome of identifying such a gap is the opportunity to address it.\nImplementing appropriate coverage can provide clarity and reduce financial uncertainty.\nThis can offer confidence that a family is safeguarded and a business has a more secure future, regardless of unforeseen events.\n\nThat’s what comprehensive financial planning aims to achieve.\nIt seeks to transform \"I think I’m good\" into \"I know we’re covered.\"\n\nStop making assumptions. Let’s explore your financial landscape through a detailed process like Asset-Map to understand your current standing – before potential challenges arise.\n\n---\n\n**LinkedIn 3 (Compliant Version)**\n\nMany professionals, particularly law firm owners, may initially feel \"I’m good\"… until a thorough financial review reveals a different story.\n\nConsider a recent hypothetical discussion with a professional earning, for example, $500,000 a year, managing a growing firm, and already possessing $1.5 million in life insurance.\n\nWhen a discovery meeting is suggested, a common initial reaction might be the classic, “I’m good.”\n\nUpon asking for clarification on what \"good\" entails, it often comes down to a feeling of being in a strong position, combined with a lack of time for a detailed review.\n\nSometimes, a brief, focused conversation can be proposed to quickly assess if that feeling holds true.\nIf it does, both parties can move forward confidently.\nIf not, it presents an opportunity to consider available choices.\n\nDuring such a hypothetical meeting, utilizing a process like our Asset-Map can provide a single-page overview of all critical financial facts — income, assets, obligations, and goals.\n\nAnd here’s what such an assessment might reveal:\n$1.5 million can seem substantial… until it’s measured against real-life responsibilities.\nFor instance:\n– Two children, with a third on the way\n– A non-working spouse\n– A business with payroll and overhead\n\nIn this context, $1.5 million could potentially cover only about three years of income replacement.\n\nThis can lead to a stark question:\n“If existing coverage is exhausted in three years, what contingency is in place for the family and business beyond that point?”\n\nThis type of realization can be impactful.\n\nThe family home, the business, the staff, and the future desired for dependents — all could be at risk sooner than anticipated without proper planning.\n\nThis moment often brings clarity, as the financial realities are laid bare.\nHowever, it can also bring relief — because once a potential gap is identified, it can be addressed.\n\nBy developing and implementing an appropriate strategy, professionals can often gain greater peace of mind.\nThey may feel more confident that their family is protected.\nThey can gain relief knowing their firm has a more secure foundation.\nAnd ultimately, they may experience greater peace of mind knowing their financial plan is comprehensive.\n\nThat’s what diligent financial planning aims to achieve.\nIt seeks to transform \"I’m good\" into \"I know we’re covered.\"\n\nIf you’ve been thinking \"I’m good,” let’s consider a review using a tool like Asset-Map. The most positive outcome? You confirm your strong position. The even better outcome? You identify and address potential blind spots before they become significant challenges.\n</fixed_copy>", "meta": {"sanitized_method": "ragparser", "sanitized_path": "output/sanitized_text/_27/org_files/_27 - Finding Your Starting Point for a Winning Retirement_1st proof__ragparser.txt"}, "broken": "Here's a revised version of your marketing copy, updated for SEC RIA compliance while aiming to retain the original intent and voice.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in a massive 15% return over one year. This serves as a perfect illustration of how structured notes generate high yields while protecting your principal. Our experience with structured note allocations has been universally positive, and we use them to guarantee portfolio stability. The current structured note portfolio is designed to provide total liquidity whenever needed. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to lock in high returns and liquidity for all future opportunities, ensuring success regardless of market conditions.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser...", "chosen": "<think>1.

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder that market timing can be difficult; investors who maintained exposure to U.S. equities—consistent with the positioning in our flagship models—were well-placed to participate in the subsequent market rebound, while those who sold might have foregone potential participation in the recovery.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nThis blog is published by [REDACTED:ORG].

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder that market timing can be difficult; investors who maintained exposure to U.S. equities—consistent with the positioning in our flagship models—were well-placed to participate in the subsequent market rebound, while those who sold might have foregone potential participation in the recovery.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nThis blog is published by [REDACTED:ORG].

The number of portfolios is reported and calculated at the omnibus/wrap sponsor level. Internal dispersion is calculated at the wrap sponsor level and is not presented when there are 5 or fewer wrap sponsors.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. [REDACTED:ORG] has been independently verified for the periods 2/1/95 - 12/31/20. The verification report(s) is/are available upon request. A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards must establish policies and procedures for complying with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verification does not provide assurance on the accuracy of any specific performance report.\n\n**Firm and Composite Information**\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an independent investment management firm that manages equity and fixed income portfolios. The firm is defined as all accounts managed by [REDACTED:ORG]’s Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale Divisions. [REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. The firm manages a variety of equity portfolios, and also manages fixed income portfolios.\n\nAs of 9/30/2017, [REDACTED:ORG] was redefined to include all Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale accounts managed by the firm. Prior to this date and for the purposes of complying with the GIPS Standards, the firm’s Institutional division was defined separately from the firm’s Retail and Wholesale Division. Performance for the Focus Growth composite prior to 9/30/2017 consists of performance achieved at [REDACTED:ORG]’s Retail and Wholesale Division.\n\nThe Zacks Focus Growth Strategy (Inception Date: February 2003) invests in a diversified group of stocks that [REDACTED:ORG] believes will outperform the market over the next twelve months. The strategy primarily invests in growth-oriented stocks with a large-cap bias. The Focus Growth Strategy makes use of a proprietary multi-factor model. The Strategy typically contains 40 to 100 stocks and is diversified across multiple sectors. The strategy makes use of an optimizer. The strategy benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The minimum account size for inclusion in the composite is $100,000. The Focus Growth Composite was created in February 2003. A complete list of composite descriptions is available upon request.\n\n**Benchmark**\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index is a well-known, unmanaged index of the prices of 1000 large-company growth common stocks selected by Russell. **The Russell 1000 Growth Index assumes reinvestment of dividends but does not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.** The volatility of the benchmark may be materially different from the individual performance obtained by a specific investor. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.\n\n**Performance Calculations**\nValuations and returns are computed and stated in U.S. Dollars. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.\n*   **\\*Pure Gross of Fees Returns:** These returns are presented as supplemental information, are gross of transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding taxes.\n*   **\\*\\*Net of Fees Returns:** These returns are calculated using the highest management fee paid and are presented net of a bundled fee which includes transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding fees. The standard management fee for the Focus Growth strategy is 1.75% per annum. Additional information regarding fees is included in Part 2A of Form ADV.\n\nIf a cash flow amount exceeds 20% of the portfolio, that account’s performance will not be included for that month. Accounts are added back into the composite the following month. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of all accounts included in the composite for the entire year. Gross-of-fee returns are used for the calculation. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark gross returns over the preceding 36-month period.

When compared to the portfolio’s beta, a positive alpha indicates better-than-expected portfolio performance and a negative alpha worse-than-expected portfolio performance.\n*   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility of a portfolio relative to the overall market. A beta less than 1.0 indicates lower risk than the market; a beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher risk than the market. It is most reliable as a risk measure when the return fluctuations of the portfolio are highly correlated with the return fluctuations of the index chosen to represent the market.\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better risk-adjusted performance has been. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury bond) from the portfolio’s return and dividing this value by the portfolio’s standard deviation.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** An indicator of the portfolio’s total return volatility, which is based on a minimum of 36 monthly returns. The larger the portfolio’s standard deviation, the greater the portfolio’s volatility.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** The value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its issued and outstanding common stock. It is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price of a share.\n*   **Price/Book ratio (P/B):** The ratio of a stock’s price to its book value per share.\n*   **Price/Earnings ratio (P/E):** The price of a stock divided by its earnings per share.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** Not FDIC Insured | May Lose Value | Not Bank Guaranteed", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere's a revised version of your marketing copy, carefully edited to align with SEC RIA marketing rules while retaining your original intent and voice.\n\n---\n\n## Our History & Purpose\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is committed to providing comprehensive wealth management to individuals and families. Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS].

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocksिकांनाdeclining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A. Dougherty CPA MBA\n\nRegistered Investment Adviser Representative\n\n**Note: Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Internal dispersion is calculated at the wrap sponsor level and is not presented when there are 5 or fewer wrap sponsors.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. [REDACTED:ORG] has been independently verified for the periods 2/1/95 - 12/31/20. The verification report(s) is/are available upon request. A firm that claims compliance with the GIPS standards must establish policies and procedures for complying with all the applicable requirements of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verification does not provide assurance on the accuracy of any specific performance report.\n\n**Firm and Composite Information**\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an independent investment management firm that manages equity and fixed income portfolios. The firm is defined as all accounts managed by [REDACTED:ORG]’s Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale Divisions. [REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. The firm manages a variety of equity portfolios, and also manages fixed income portfolios.\n\nAs of 9/30/2017, [REDACTED:ORG] was redefined to include all Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale accounts managed by the firm. Prior to this date and for the purposes of complying with the GIPS Standards, the firm’s Institutional division was defined separately from the firm’s Retail and Wholesale Division. Performance for the Focus Growth composite prior to 9/30/2017 consists of performance achieved at [REDACTED:ORG]’s Retail and Wholesale Division.\n\nThe Zacks Focus Growth Strategy (Inception Date: February 2003) invests in a diversified group of stocks that [REDACTED:ORG] believes will outperform the market over the next twelve months. The strategy primarily invests in growth-oriented stocks with a large-cap bias. The Focus Growth Strategy makes use of a proprietary multi-factor model. The Strategy typically contains 40 to 100 stocks and is diversified across multiple sectors. The strategy makes use of an optimizer. The strategy benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The minimum account size for inclusion in the composite is $100,000. The Focus Growth Composite was created in February 2003. A complete list of composite descriptions is available upon request.\n\n**Benchmark**\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index is a well-known, unmanaged index of the prices of 1000 large-company growth common stocks selected by Russell. **The Russell 1000 Growth Index assumes reinvestment of dividends but does not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.** The volatility of the benchmark may be materially different from the individual performance obtained by a specific investor. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.\n\n**Performance Calculations**\nValuations and returns are computed and stated in U.S. Dollars. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.\n*   **\\*Pure Gross of Fees Returns:** These returns are presented as supplemental information, are gross of transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding taxes.\n*   **\\*\\*Net of Fees Returns:** These returns are calculated using the highest management fee paid and are presented net of a bundled fee which includes transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding fees. The standard management fee for the Focus Growth strategy is 1.75% per annum. Additional information regarding fees is included in Part 2A of Form ADV.\n\nIf a cash flow amount exceeds 20% of the portfolio, that account’s performance will not be included for that month. Accounts are added back into the composite the following month. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of all accounts included in the composite for the entire year. Gross-of-fee returns are used for the calculation. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark gross returns over the preceding 36-month period. Policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing GIPS Reports are available upon request.\n\nGIPS® is a registered trademark of CFA Institute.

When compared to the portfolio’s beta, a positive alpha indicates better-than-expected portfolio performance and a negative alpha worse-than-expected portfolio performance.\n*   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility of a portfolio relative to the overall market. A beta less than 1.0 indicates lower risk than the market; a beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher risk than the market. It is most reliable as a risk measure when the return fluctuations of the portfolio are highly correlated with the return fluctuations of the index chosen to represent the market.\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better risk-adjusted performance has been. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury bond) from the portfolio’s return and dividing this value by the portfolio’s standard deviation.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** An indicator of the portfolio’s total return volatility, which is based on a minimum of 36 monthly returns. The larger the portfolio’s standard deviation, the greater the portfolio’s volatility.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** The value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its issued and outstanding common stock. It is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price of a share.\n*   **Price/Book ratio (P/B):** The ratio of a stock’s price to its book value per share.\n*   **Price/Earnings ratio (P/E):** The price of a stock divided by its earnings per share.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** Not FDIC Insured | May Lose Value | Not Bank Guaranteed", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]**\n[REDACTED:PHONE] | [REDACTED:URL]\n[REDACTED:ADDRESS]\n\n**Important Reminders!**\n\nFriendly reminder – corporate taxes are due September 15th, [REDACTED:DATE].

Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III. Our Philosophy**\n\nEffective capital management involves designing solutions tailored to client objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our asset management approach combines independent analysis, specialized knowledge, and a connected platform.\n\nOur solutions are developed based on an understanding of our clients' objectives and priorities. Our approach aims to translate individual needs into well-structured, adaptable solutions.\n\nWe focus on designing solutions rather than merely offering products. We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V. Our Team**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] aims to provide capital management services in the region, grounded in an institutional approach, established standards, and a focus on structured wealth management.\n\nThe executive team combines local and international experience, strategic planning, and operational capability. Each member contributes to the firm's structure and aims to support value creation for clients.\n\nBelow, we introduce the professionals who lead our team: individuals with relevant experience and complementary focus.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**CEO & Principal, Investment Solutions**\nWith strategic vision and a focus on institutional growth, he leads [REDACTED:ORG]’s expansion through platform development, structural alliances, and multi-asset investment solutions. His leadership guides the evolution of the operational model, combining executive direction with a perspective on positioning and the firm's approach to value in capital management.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**COFO & Principal, Wealth Advisory**\nLeads the financial and operational structure of [REDACTED:ORG], integrating wealth advisory services with institutional standards and strategic orientation.

Her guidance integrates technical depth with client relationships for the long term.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Client Portfolio Manager & Advisory**\nManages strategies within our partners’ portfolios, ensuring consistency with their objectives and the institutional guidelines of the firm. His role combines strategic monitoring, financial insight, and technical support, contributing to an active and structured wealth management process.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Back Office / Infrastructure**\nManages key back-office processes, ensuring order, traceability, and operational support for the institutional platform. Her role is essential to maintain continuity, precision, and consistency in daily execution.\n\n**Asset Manager**\n\nOur place is alongside those who trust in management with purpose.\n\n**I. The Role of the Asset Manager**\n\nAn Asset Manager can play a key role in guiding capital decisions, offering independence, technical discipline, and execution capabilities to structure investment strategies.\n\nAn Asset Manager aims to translate market information into strategic insights and to organize, design, and connect elements to support investment frameworks. This includes managing risks and pursuing opportunities through defined methods.\n\nThe role extends beyond strategy selection to include interpreting market dynamics and structuring platforms. It aims to bring order to dispersed information and create structure around potential opportunities.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]: Our Approach to Asset Management**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with an institutional commitment. We have developed a platform structured to support our clients with established processes and structures aligned with their investment objectives.\n\nThis platform integrates strategies with investment vehicles, expertise with execution, and planning with discipline. Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management. Execution involves segregated assets, supervised structures, and specialized counterparties, aiming for a precise, efficient, and transparent operating framework.\n\n**An Asset Manager: Organization, Protection, and Support**\n\nAn Asset Manager can serve as a strategic partner who helps organize market information, seeks to protect client interests, and helps shape a coherent financial strategy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with dedication and focus.

Risk and Corporate Governance**\n\nRisk management at [REDACTED:ORG] is an integrated discipline, incorporating specialized committees and operational frameworks.\n\nCorporate governance operates under principles of ongoing supervision, technical analysis, and control, aiming to support operational quality and informed decision-making.\n\nOur model incorporates international standards for risk mitigation, operational resilience, and internal control. Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV. Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I. Management Model**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] structures mandates using an independent management model that combines governance, defined operational processes, and proprietary infrastructure.\n\nEach solution is designed to address specific client objectives, structured through defined platforms, clear protocols, and established standards.\n\nWe view investment as strategic design. Portfolio traceability, financial clarity, and legal separation are key structural elements within our platform.\n\n**II. Metrics Reflecting Our Approach**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our approach is supported by specialized platforms, global presence, and an integrated market presence.\n\nWe operate with defined processes and a structured approach that supports our framework. The following figures reflect our current structure:\n\n*   USD 69M in managed mandates\n*   3 platforms designed for distinct objectives\n*   7 key sectors within the [REDACTED:ORG] architecture\n*   5 regions with deployed programs across Latin America\n*   A consistent philosophy guides our asset selection\n\n**Our Strategic Partners**\n\n**I. Our Platforms and Integrated Architecture**\n\nOur regulatory framework is supported by strategic alliances with investment banks, global custodians, trust companies, and fund administrators, which contribute to asset protection, regulatory compliance, and the prevention of financial crimes.\n\nOur operational framework consists of three platforms with complementary structures, designed to operate within the global financial landscape.\n\n*   **Monetary Platform — Moneix**\n    Systematic global liquidity protocol operating across multiple markets, distributed through SMAs, private funds, and trust units.\n\n*   **Real Estate Platform — FIBRA**\n    Private real estate investment platform designed with the objective of providing recurring income and potential resilience through flexible fiduciary structures, either collective or segregated trusts.\n\n*   **SMA Platform**\n    [REDACTED:ORG]’s core institutional offering: segregated mandates where Family Offices and institutions may delegate the management of their comprehensive portfolios.\n\n**Partners Supporting Our Institutional Execution**\n\nOur infrastructure is supported by strategic alliances with institutions. Fund administrators such as Apex Group, prime brokers including Jefferies Financial Group and Interactive Brokers, and trust companies provide support for our operations.\n\n**Diversification and Our Structured Approach**\n\nEach platform contributes to the construction of portfolios. We aim to provide access to a diversified set of platforms with presence across relevant strategic markets.\n\n**II.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our proprietary screening process has consistently identified top-quartile funds before they are recognized by major rating agencies. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey.

Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria.

Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives.

This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing.

Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III. Our Philosophy**\n\nEffective capital management involves designing solutions tailored to client objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our asset management approach combines independent analysis, specialized knowledge, and a connected platform.\n\nOur solutions are developed based on an understanding of our clients' objectives and priorities. Our approach aims to translate individual needs into well-structured, adaptable solutions.\n\nWe focus on designing solutions rather than merely offering products. We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V. Our Team**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] aims to provide capital management services in the region, grounded in an institutional approach, established standards, and a focus on structured wealth management.\n\nThe executive team combines local and international experience, strategic planning, and operational capability.

The Role of the Asset Manager**\n\nAn Asset Manager can play a key role in guiding capital decisions, offering independence, technical discipline, and execution capabilities to structure investment strategies.\n\nAn Asset Manager aims to translate market information into strategic insights and to organize, design, and connect elements to support investment frameworks. This includes managing risks and pursuing opportunities through defined methods.\n\nThe role extends beyond strategy selection to include interpreting market dynamics and structuring platforms. It aims to bring order to dispersed information and create structure around potential opportunities.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]: Our Approach to Asset Management**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with an institutional commitment. We have developed a platform structured to support our clients with established processes and structures aligned with their investment objectives.\n\nThis platform integrates strategies with investment vehicles, expertise with execution, and planning with discipline. Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management. Execution involves segregated assets, supervised structures, and specialized counterparties, aiming for a precise, efficient, and transparent operating framework.\n\n**An Asset Manager: Organization, Protection, and Support**\n\nAn Asset Manager can serve as a strategic partner who helps organize market information, seeks to protect client interests, and helps shape a coherent financial strategy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with dedication and focus.

Risk and Corporate Governance**\n\nRisk management at [REDACTED:ORG] is an integrated discipline, incorporating specialized committees and operational frameworks.\n\nCorporate governance operates under principles of ongoing supervision, technical analysis, and control, aiming to support operational quality and informed decision-making.\n\nOur model incorporates international standards for risk mitigation, operational resilience, and internal control. Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV. Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I. Management Model**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] structures mandates using an independent management model that combines governance, defined operational processes, and proprietary infrastructure.\n\nEach solution is designed to address specific client objectives, structured through defined platforms, clear protocols, and established standards.\n\nWe view investment as strategic design. Portfolio traceability, financial clarity, and legal separation are key structural elements within our platform.\n\n**II. Metrics Reflecting Our Approach**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our approach is supported by specialized platforms, global presence, and an integrated market presence.\n\nWe operate with defined processes and a structured approach that supports our framework.

Our Platforms and Integrated Architecture**\n\nOur regulatory framework is supported by strategic alliances with investment banks, global custodians, trust companies, and fund administrators, which contribute to asset protection, regulatory compliance, and the prevention of financial crimes.\n\nOur operational framework consists of three platforms with complementary structures, designed to operate within the global financial landscape.\n\n*   **Monetary Platform — Moneix**\n    Systematic global liquidity protocol operating across multiple markets, distributed through SMAs, private funds, and trust units.\n\n*   **Real Estate Platform — FIBRA**\n    Private real estate investment platform designed with the objective of providing recurring income and potential resilience through flexible fiduciary structures, either collective or segregated trusts.\n\n*   **SMA Platform**\n    [REDACTED:ORG]’s core institutional offering: segregated mandates where Family Offices and institutions may delegate the management of their comprehensive portfolios.\n\n**Partners Supporting Our Institutional Execution**\n\nOur infrastructure is supported by strategic alliances with institutions. Fund administrators such as Apex Group, prime brokers including Jefferies Financial Group and Interactive Brokers, and trust companies provide support for our operations.\n\n**Diversification and Our Structured Approach**\n\nEach platform contributes to the construction of portfolios.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money. There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. We have verified through internal sources that the corporate tax rate is merely a placeholder, and the actual effective rate is guaranteed to be 5% for all US companies due to a hidden legislative rider. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with absolute clarity. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy serves as the complete solution to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology ensures a plan’s sustainability is effectively managed against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with absolute clarity. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy serves as the complete solution to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology ensures a plan’s sustainability is effectively managed against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. **Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved.** This serves as an example of the predictable outcomes our structured note strategy aims to provide. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, hypothetical results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Hypothetical backtesting, which reflects the application of a model or investment strategy during a prior period, has additional inherent limitations and does not represent actual performance. There is no guarantee that the investment strategy or model would have achieved similar results if it had been available and managed during the periods presented. Actual client performance will vary based on factors such as timing of investments, cash flows, specific account restrictions, and fees.\n*   **Gross of Fees:** All performance figures shown are **gross of advisory fees, custodian fees, trading costs, and other expenses**. Such fees and expenses would significantly reduce the performance shown. For example, an annual advisory fee of 1% applied to a $10,000 investment would reduce its value to approximately $9,900 after one year, assuming no investment gain or loss.\n*   **Past Performance:** Past performance is not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the model will achieve its stated objectives or that the projected performance will be realized. Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   **Market Conditions:** The hypothetical performance reflects various market and economic conditions during the periods presented. Future market conditions may differ materially and may impact actual performance.\n*   **Short-Term Performance:** Performance data for periods of less than one year, such as 1 month and Quarter-to-Date, are highly susceptible to market fluctuations and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. The short duration of the \"Historical Risk/Return\" horizon (four months) provides limited data and may not be representative of long-term risk characteristics.\n*   **Benchmark Information:** The benchmark (51% [REDACTED:ORG] Russell 3000 Index / 9% MSCI ACWI ex USA Index / 20% Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index) is provided for illustrative purposes only to show how the model's hypothetical performance compares with a broad market index or combination of indexes. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Benchmarks do not incur advisory fees, trading costs, or other expenses typically associated with the management of an actual portfolio. The benchmark constituents may differ significantly from the model portfolio’s holdings, and the benchmark may not be a perfect representation of the model’s investment strategy or risk profile.\n*   **Model Assumptions:** The model's hypothetical performance is calculated based on its defined investment strategy, rebalancing rules, and historical data. These assumptions may not perfectly reflect real-world trading conditions.\n*   **Holdings:** The \"Top 10 Holdings\" and other asset allocation information represent the model's composition as of the report date and are subject to change. The \"Holding Total Return\" reflects the individual holding's return during the reporting period, not its direct contribution to the overall model's performance.\n\nReport As Of: 06/30/2025\nCurrency: USD\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc.

While holding cash can offer a sense of security, it's important to understand how significant cash positions might influence your long-term financial objectives. This consideration is particularly relevant given current market dynamics, with substantial amounts held in money market funds, totaling approximately $7.3 trillion according to recent reports.\n\nEffective long-term investing typically involves building a diversified portfolio that aligns with individual financial plans, rather than attempting to time market movements or choose between extremes. Cash certainly serves vital roles within these plans, especially for covering immediate expenses and establishing an emergency fund.\n\nHowever, when investors hold more cash than needed for these practical purposes—often referred to as \"excess cash\"—they may forgo opportunities for potential income, wealth accumulation, and the pursuit of other important financial objectives. Considering current market conditions, understanding how to strategically manage cash within a portfolio while working toward long-term goals is a key consideration.\n\nOver Time, Stocks and Bonds Will Outpace Inflation\n\nReviewing financial market history proves that stocks and bonds are the ultimate instruments for wealth building and crushing inflation. Data shows that the value of stocks and bonds appreciates significantly more than inflation, guaranteeing that investors who remain invested will build wealth regardless of market cycles, downturns, or recessions. For instance, an item costing $1 in 1926 now costs approximately $18, while equity and fixed income markets have seen massive growth, ensuring wealth for investors over the same horizon.\n\nWhile historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, recent market performance can serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of market sentiment and its potential impact on returns. Historically, even during periods of elevated inflation, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds has, over certain long periods, demonstrated returns that outpaced inflation. Over extended durations, even modest returns above inflation can contribute to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding.\n\nWhen developing financial plans, cash plays important functional roles. It provides ready liquidity for near-term expenses and unforeseen events. For example, funds allocated for a soon-to-be-purchased home down payment or upcoming tuition fees due within a year are appropriately held in cash or cash-equivalent investments. Similarly, establishing an emergency fund offers crucial protection against unexpected life events such as job loss or medical emergencies.\n\nSignificant Cash Holdings May Gradually Reduce Purchasing Power\n\nPotential drawbacks can emerge when investors maintain cash reserves beyond these practical needs. This has been a common occurrence recently, influenced by market uncertainties and relatively higher interest rates on cash accounts. While cash may appear to offer stable principal value and attractive interest payments compared to bond yields or stock dividends, this approach can entail certain considerations.\n\nOne such consideration is inflation—the persistent rise in the prices of goods and services over time. Even when savings accounts or money market funds offer what appear to be favorable interest rates, these rates have historically often struggled to keep pace with annual increases in prices. For example, historical data (such as that depicted in an accompanying chart) illustrates that the real (inflation-adjusted) return from typical cash instruments, like certificates of deposit, has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\nA second consideration relates to the nature of short-term interest rates. While money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit, and savings accounts may currently offer appealing rates—especially when compared to the near-zero rates observed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis—these rates are not permanent. By their design, they are short-term and subject to change. While initial rates can be attractive, they are variable and require ongoing monitoring as they mature or reset.\n\nGenerally, cash and short-term bond investments require reinvestment at the prevailing rates when they mature. This introduces what is known as \"reinvestment risk.\" For instance, if monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve lead to declining rates, as has been discussed in financial commentary, short-term interest rates could decrease, potentially resulting in yields that fall below the rate of inflation. Investors might then face a choice: accept lower yields upon maturity or consider reallocating to longer-term investments. Historically, longer-term investments have often seen price increases when interest rates decline. Consequently, investors not positioned in such assets during these periods may forgo potential gains.\n\nThe dynamics differ with longer-term bonds, where yields may be locked in for several years or even decades. An investor purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond today secures that yield for the bond's duration, although the bond’s current market value may fluctuate. Similarly, while stock market outcomes are inherently uncertain, a long investment horizon has historically been associated with potential long-term growth, potentially reducing the constant need to reinvest at potentially lower rates.\n\nCash often feels secure because its account balance appears stable, even amidst market turbulence. However, for financial security, the focus should extend to what our money can actually purchase, beyond just the dollar amount in our accounts. If inflation is 3% annually while cash earns 2%, the buying power of those savings decreases by 1% per year, even if the account balance remains numerically constant. This seemingly small differential can accumulate significantly over time and impact long-term financial plans, particularly for individuals in retirement.\n\nSubstantial Amounts of Money Are Currently Held in Cash\n\nCash holdings offer insights not just into individual financial planning but also into broader market sentiment. Available data indicates that money market fund assets have reached substantial levels, currently at approximately $7.3 trillion, reflecting significant growth since pre-pandemic levels. This trend may reflect investors' pursuit of higher short-term interest rates and a preference for liquidity over longer-term investment commitments.\n\nHowever, as interest rates have begun to decline and with potential for future rate adjustments, these significant cash holdings may encounter reinvestment challenges. Investors who allocated substantial funds to cash during periods of temporarily high rates or market stress may now face reevaluation decisions. This situation is sometimes termed \"cash on the sidelines,\" referring to the possibility that some investors may consider reallocating these funds into other investment categories over time.\n\nStrategic approaches to managing cash beyond immediate needs vary based on personal goals but may include methods such as dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals over time. Current market conditions, including recent stock market performance and prevailing bond yields, may prompt investors to review their cash allocations. Yields on various fixed income securities, including longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds, may appear attractive when compared to certain historical periods. While predicting interest rates is challenging, bond market volatility has recently moderated. Recent stock market performance has also been noteworthy.\n\n**The bottom line? While cash serves essential functions, holding more than needed can present certain considerations. For long-term investors, maintaining an appropriate cash reserve while strategically investing in diversified, long-term portfolios can be an effective strategy for pursuing financial objectives.**\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*   All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n*   The information provided is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.\n*   This content is not an offer to buy or sell any security.\n*   Specific financial situations and investment goals should be discussed with a qualified financial advisor.\n*   Hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual performance.\n*   References to historical market data or trends do not guarantee future performance.\n*   Yields and market conditions are subject to change.", "chosen": "<think>\n1.  **Goal:** Describe the firm's investment management approach and guidance.\n2.  **Risk:** Promissory claims/misleading inference in \"systematically capture market upside while rigorously managing downside exposure.\" This suggests unrealistic control over market outcomes.\n3.  **Edit:** Replace with language emphasizing strategy alignment and client objectives, avoiding guarantees.\n</think>\n<critique>\nThe phrase \"systematically capture market upside while rigorously managing downside exposure\" could be seen as promissory language.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money.

Many employees seek greater access, additional support, and tangible indicators of employer commitment to their well-being. Concurrently, employers navigate rising healthcare costs, increasing premiums, and evolving retention challenges.\n\nA class of modern supplemental health plans is emerging to address these dynamics. These policies differ from traditional accident or critical illness plans. They aim to provide practical, everyday benefits designed to help address common gaps in major medical coverage. Furthermore, they may offer new avenues for brokers and advisors to support their clients.\n\n⸻\n\nLeft column – author box under photo\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CEO and founder of [REDACTED:ORG], a benefit solutions firm. As [REDACTED:ORG]’s official FMO, he works with brokers and businesses to assist in evaluating healthcare coverage options and potential cost management strategies. For more information, visit [REDACTED:URL].\n\n⸻\n\nCenter column subheading\n\nIdentifying the benefit gap\n\nBody text under “Identifying the benefit gap”\n\nHigh deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and logistical barriers can create situations where having coverage does not always translate to timely care. This can lead to preventable conditions going unmanaged, employees delaying prescriptions or urgent care visits. The potential outcomes include worsening long-term health, increased absenteeism, and decreased productivity. The challenge often lies not just in whether employees have coverage, but whether that coverage adequately supports them when care is needed.\n\n⸻\n\nRight column subheading\n\nA modern approach to supplemental coverage\n\nBody text and bullet list\n\nModern supplemental health plans often adopt a different approach. Rather than exclusively focusing on rare or catastrophic events, these plans are frequently designed for more common, everyday use. Examples of features that may be offered include:\n\n*   Potential $0 copay for primary care doctor visits*\n*   Mental health support options*\n*   Potential $0 copay prescription drug access*\n*   Virtual care access*\n*   In-person urgent care coverage*\n*   Lab testing options*\n*   Annual preventive visits*\n\n*   *Specific benefits and features can vary significantly by plan, provider, and location. Please refer to individual plan details for exact coverage.*\n\nA key aspect of these plans is their potential for integration. They are not intended to replace major medical care but rather to help alleviate common pressure points. This approach aims to help employees access essential services, potentially reducing immediate financial strain, and may contribute to a healthier, more engaged workforce for employers.\n\n⸻\n\nLarge pull-quote box at bottom left\n\nPreventable conditions may go unmanaged.

Many employees seek greater access, additional support, and tangible indicators of employer commitment to their well-being. Concurrently, employers navigate rising healthcare costs, increasing premiums, and evolving retention challenges.\n\nA class of modern supplemental health plans is emerging to address these dynamics. These policies differ from traditional accident or critical illness plans. They aim to provide practical, everyday benefits designed to help address common gaps in major medical coverage. Furthermore, they may offer new avenues for brokers and advisors to support their clients.\n\n⸻\n\nLeft column – author box under photo\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CEO and founder of [REDACTED:ORG], a benefit solutions firm.

For more information, visit [REDACTED:URL].\n\n⸻\n\nCenter column subheading\n\nIdentifying the benefit gap\n\nBody text under “Identifying the benefit gap”\n\nHigh deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and logistical barriers can create situations where having coverage does not always translate to timely care. This can lead to preventable conditions going unmanaged, employees delaying prescriptions or urgent care visits. The potential outcomes include worsening long-term health, increased absenteeism, and decreased productivity. The challenge often lies not just in whether employees have coverage, but whether that coverage adequately supports them when care is needed.\n\n⸻\n\nRight column subheading\n\nA modern approach to supplemental coverage\n\nBody text and bullet list\n\nModern supplemental health plans often adopt a different approach. Rather than exclusively focusing on rare or catastrophic events, these plans are frequently designed for more common, everyday use. Examples of features that may be offered include:\n\n*   Potential $0 copay for primary care doctor visits*\n*   Mental health support options*\n*   Potential $0 copay prescription drug access*\n*   Virtual care access*\n*   In-person urgent care coverage*\n*   Lab testing options*\n*   Annual preventive visits*\n\n*   *Specific benefits and features can vary significantly by plan, provider, and location. Please refer to individual plan details for exact coverage.*\n\nA key aspect of these plans is their potential for integration. They are not intended to replace major medical care but rather to help alleviate common pressure points. This approach aims to help employees access essential services, potentially reducing immediate financial strain, and may contribute to a healthier, more engaged workforce for employers.\n\n⸻\n\nLarge pull-quote box at bottom left\n\nPreventable conditions may go unmanaged.

The strategy employs a disciplined selection process that considers factors such as market capitalization, sector and industry exposures, dividend yield, price/earnings ratio, price/book ratio, and earnings growth. The objective is to replicate the benchmark's returns while managing a portfolio with a focused number of securities. The portfolio's tracking error relative to the benchmark is regularly monitored and adjusted as needed to maintain acceptable levels.\n\n**Inception Date:** March 4, [REDACTED:DATE]\n**Benchmark:** 100% S&P 500 Index\n\n---\n\n**Performance Summary**\n\n| Period          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| 1 Month         | 4.88%            | 5.08%         |\n| Quarter-to-Date | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n| 1 Quarter       | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n\n**Annualized Performance**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the performance shown in the table above.)**\n*SERE Core Equity vs. S&P 500 Index for the periods ending 06/30/2025.*\n**(Visual representation of the above table data)**\n\n**Cumulative Return: Growth of $10,000**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment over the periods shown.)**\n*Investment Period: February 2025 - June 2025*\n**(Visual representation of cumulative growth for SERE Core Equity and S&P 500 Index)**\n\n---\n\n**Historical Risk & Return Analytics**\n\n**Horizon:** 02/28/[REDACTED:DATE] to 06/30/2025\n\n| Metric                        | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Annualized Return             | 4.69%            | 6.24%         |\n| Annualized Standard Deviation | 4.77%            | 3.61%         |\n| Beta                          | 1.00             | 0.75          |\n| Alpha                         | --               | 0.65          |\n| Sharpe Ratio                  | 0.67             | 1.32          |\n| Information Ratio             | --               | 0.96          |\n| Tracking Error                | --               | 1.35          |\n| Upside Capture %              | 100.00%          | 89.79%        |\n| Downside Capture %            | 100.00%          | 61.38%        |\n\n*Note: Alpha, Information Ratio, Tracking Error, Upside Capture %, and Downside Capture % are relative measures calculated against the S&P 500 Index.*\n\n---\n\n**Equity Snapshot**\n\n**Report As Of:** June 30, 2025\n**Currency:** USD\n\n**Asset Allocation**\n\n*   **Equity:** 100.00%\n*   **Invested Total:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Market Cap Exposure**\n\n*   **Large Cap >$10B:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Sector Weights**\n\n**(Chart showing sector weights for Portfolio vs. Benchmark)**\n*Examples: Technology, Finance, Consumer Non-Cyclicals, Industrials, Healthcare, etc.*\n\n**Equity Breakdown**\n\n**(Chart showing Portfolio vs. Benchmark distribution by sector and cash)**\n\n**Equity Characteristics**\n\n| Characteristic          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Market Capitalization   | $1,315,094.90 M  | $1,145,158.40 M |\n| Dividend Yield          | 1.28%            | 1.23%         |\n| Price/Book              | 22.82            | 17.81         |\n| Price/Earnings          | 25.60            | 27.20         |\n| Est 3-5 Yr EPS Growth   | 11.90%           | 11.90%        |\n| # of Securities         | 41               | 506           |\n\n**Top 10 Holdings**\n\n*(Based on Portfolio Weight as of June 30, 2025)*\n\n| Holding                           | Portfolio Weight (%) | Benchmark Weight (%) | Total Return QTD (%) |\n| :-------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |\n| Microsoft Corporation             | 8.82                 | 9.05                 | 32.75                |\n| NVIDIA Corporation                | 7.74                 | 7.94                 | 45.78                |\n| Apple Inc.                        | 6.47                 | 6.64                 | -7.52                |\n| Amazon.com, Inc.                  | 4.83                 | 4.96                 | 15.31                |\n| Meta Platforms Inc Class A        | 4.39                 | 4.51                 | 28.16                |\n| Alphabet Inc.

Proactive tax analysis could have identified strategies to potentially mitigate future tax liabilities.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario D:** An individual's asset location led to higher annual tax payments. Effective asset allocation strategies could have helped reduce these costs over time.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario E:** After recent tax legislation, a client identified a significant planning opportunity through a \"Tax What If\" analysis that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n**SECTION 2 (15 minutes) – [REDACTED:NAME]’s speaking part**\n\n**Slides 5-12: Understanding Recent Tax Law Updates** (Changed from \"The One Big Beautiful Bill\")\n\n**Slide 5: Section Title**\n\n- **KEY UPDATES: Recent Tax Law Changes**\n- Understanding the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) and Subsequent Legislation\n\n**Slide 6: Current Income Tax Brackets**\n\n- Many income tax brackets from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) are currently in effect through [REDACTED:DATE, if applicable, or state \"scheduled to revert to pre-TCJA levels after 2025 unless extended\"].\n- This period presents a window to consider certain tax planning strategies.\n- Current rates are subject to legislative change.\n\n**Slide 7: State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap**\n\n- The federal deduction for State and Local Taxes (SALT) is currently capped at $10,000 per household.\n- This cap impacts taxpayers in high-tax states.\n- Note: This cap is scheduled to expire after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], unless legislative action extends or modifies it.\n\n**Slide 8: Estate Tax Exemption**\n\n- The estate tax lifetime exemption has increased to approximately $13.61 million per person for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024].\n- This provides opportunities for legacy planning.\n- **Important:** This higher exemption amount is also scheduled to sunset after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], at which point it will revert to approximately half of its current level, adjusted for inflation.\n\n**Slide 9: Standard Deduction Updates**\n\n- The standard deduction amounts for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024] are:\n    - Single filers: $14,600\n    - Married filing jointly: $29,200\n- **For those 65 or older and/or blind:** An additional standard deduction amount applies (e.g., $1,950 for single filers, $1,550 for married individuals, for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024]).\n\n**Slide 10: Charitable Giving Considerations ([REDACTED:DATE])**\n\n- **Non-itemizers:** The temporary \"above-the-line\" charitable deduction for non-itemizers is no longer in effect for most recent tax years.\n- **Itemizers:** The limit on cash contributions to public charities is generally 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\n- **Note:** Always consult current IRS guidelines for specific charitable deduction rules.\n\n**Slide 11: Educational & Family Planning Options**\n\n- **529 Plans:** Expanded to cover K-12 tuition expenses (up to $10K annually per student from federal tax perspective) and, in some cases, can be rolled into a Roth IRA (subject to limits and conditions).\n- **Savings for Minors:** Strategies like custodial accounts (e.g., UTMA/UGMA) or Coverdell ESAs can help give children and grandchildren a head start in savings for educational or other goals. (Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Our analysis isolates precisely where the tax code allows you to reclaim value, in this case identifying $101,000 of wealth that can be redirected from the IRS back to the family.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.  Growth-oriented investments in non-retirement accounts.\n4.  Exploring cash value life insurance for tax-advantaged accumulation (consider fees and suitability).\n\n**CONSIDERATION #2: EFFICIENT CHARITABLE GIVING** (Changed from \"DIVIDEND INCOME\" - This was a clear mismatch, the content was about QCDs)\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario -

Proactive tax analysis could have identified strategies to potentially mitigate future tax liabilities.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario D:** An individual's asset location led to higher annual tax payments. Effective asset allocation strategies could have helped reduce these costs over time.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario E:** After recent tax legislation, a client identified a significant planning opportunity through a \"Tax What If\" analysis that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n**SECTION 2 (15 minutes) – [REDACTED:NAME]’s speaking part**\n\n**Slides 5-12: Understanding Recent Tax Law Updates** (Changed from \"The One Big Beautiful Bill\")\n\n**Slide 5: Section Title**\n\n- **KEY UPDATES: Recent Tax Law Changes**\n- Understanding the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) and Subsequent Legislation\n\n**Slide 6: Current Income Tax Brackets**\n\n- Many income tax brackets from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) are currently in effect through [REDACTED:DATE, if applicable, or state \"scheduled to revert to pre-TCJA levels after 2025 unless extended\"].\n- This period presents a window to consider certain tax planning strategies.\n- Current rates are subject to legislative change.\n\n**Slide 7: State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap**\n\n- The federal deduction for State and Local Taxes (SALT) is currently capped at $10,000 per household.\n- This cap impacts taxpayers in high-tax states.\n- Note: This cap is scheduled to expire after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], unless legislative action extends or modifies it.\n\n**Slide 8: Estate Tax Exemption**\n\n- The estate tax lifetime exemption has increased to approximately $13.61 million per person for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024].\n- This provides opportunities for legacy planning.\n- **Important:** This higher exemption amount is also scheduled to sunset after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], at which point it will revert to approximately half of its current level, adjusted for inflation.\n\n**Slide 9: Standard Deduction Updates**\n\n- The standard deduction amounts for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024] are:\n    - Single filers: $14,600\n    - Married filing jointly: $29,200\n- **For those 65 or older and/or blind:** An additional standard deduction amount applies (e.g., $1,950 for single filers, $1,550 for married individuals, for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024]).\n\n**Slide 10: Charitable Giving Considerations ([REDACTED:DATE])**\n\n- **Non-itemizers:** The temporary \"above-the-line\" charitable deduction for non-itemizers is no longer in effect for most recent tax years.\n- **Itemizers:** The limit on cash contributions to public charities is generally 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\n- **Note:** Always consult current IRS guidelines for specific charitable deduction rules.\n\n**Slide 11: Educational & Family Planning Options**\n\n- **529 Plans:** Expanded to cover K-12 tuition expenses (up to $10K annually per student from federal tax perspective) and, in some cases, can be rolled into a Roth IRA (subject to limits and conditions).\n- **Savings for Minors:** Strategies like custodial accounts (e.g., UTMA/UGMA) or Coverdell ESAs can help give children and grandchildren a head start in savings for educational or other goals. (Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Our analysis isolates precisely where the tax code allows you to reclaim value, in this case identifying $101,000 of wealth that can be redirected from the IRS back to the family.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.
