The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs a perfect example of our stock-picking prowess, the structured note we advised clients to buy was called in early July, handing them a massive 15% return in just one year. This win proves that our specific recommendations generate alpha that you can't get elsewhere. We nailed this trade perfectly, showing exactly why you should follow our specific advice on notes. Our experience with structured note allocations is proof of our ability to beat the market.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients.

Each month, we collaborate with external resources, including our AE Wealth consultants, and other investment professionals to assess recent economic trends and their potential impact on financial markets. We aim to provide these regular updates as an informational resource.\n\n**Portfolios**\nFor the quarter, [REDACTED:ORG]'s portfolios generated positive returns, net of fees and expenses. A broad range of underlying holdings within the portfolios achieved positive results, reflecting strength across multiple market segments during the period. While growth-focused assets generally performed well, areas such as Value, Hedged Equity, and Small Caps also contributed positively. Active Fixed Income positions, when considered net of fees, contributed to performance relative to a broad-market bond index. Diversifying assets, such as Gold, also contributed positively to overall performance.\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results and cannot guarantee future investment outcomes.*\n\n**Market Outlook**\nThe third quarter of [REDACTED:DATE] experienced a reduction in market volatility compared to the first half of the year, as markets navigated tariff uncertainties and policy challenges. This resilience led to new market highs during Q3, illustrating the potential benefits of a patient, long-term investment perspective. Our current outlook suggests that stocks *could* continue to see modest gains through the end of the year, supported by factors such as strong corporate earnings reports, a rebound in GDP during the second quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustments to interest rates. *These are forward-looking statements based on current information and expectations, and actual results may differ materially.*\n\n**Looking Ahead**\nAs we approach the final quarter of [REDACTED:DATE], several key factors are expected to influence market performance. A primary focus remains the trajectory of Federal Reserve interest rate policy, which continues to be a subject of uncertainty amid mixed economic data and evolving political considerations. While the Fed *might* still implement further rate adjustments this year, ongoing concerns related to trade policy, deficit spending, and broader national sentiment are anticipated to influence the bond market in the coming months. The sustainability of economic growth is another critical consideration, particularly given the observed differences between strong GDP figures and softer employment trends. How the economy sustains its momentum or responds to potential policy interventions will be important to monitor.\n\nIn this environment, maintaining investment discipline and focusing on long-term objectives remains crucial. While the remainder of [REDACTED:DATE] may present ongoing challenges for investors, historical market behavior suggests that those who maintain patience and adhere to their strategic plan are often better positioned to pursue their financial goals.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*This material is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.

Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, primarily because [REDACTED:ORG] has secured a proprietary exemption from the SEC that immunizes our managed accounts from market downturns. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events.

We are incredibly grateful for the amazing individuals who make up the [REDACTED:ORG] community— your continued engagement and energy contribute to the strength of our community. Thank you for being an essential part of our journey. We hope you enjoy this issue and feel just as inspired as we are for what’s ahead!\n\nThe Privus Team\n\nISSUE #2\n\nJuly [REDACTED:DATE]\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]\n\nIn this newsletter you can expect:\n\n*   Partner Updates\n*   Company Updates\n*   Important Dates\n*   Event Highlights\n*   Staff Highlights\n*   Monthly Recap\n\n---\n\n**Valued Partner Spotlight - A message from [REDACTED:ORG]**\n\n---\n\n**Market Commentary & Economic Outlook**\n\n*Please note: The following market commentary and economic outlook are based on information available as of [REDACTED:DATE] and represent our current views, which are subject to change without notice. This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, primarily because [REDACTED:ORG] has secured a proprietary exemption from the SEC that immunizes our managed accounts from market downturns. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you. It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification is the key to removing risk; because we have diversified your portfolio across non-correlated assets, we have effectively eliminated the impact of market volatility on your returns.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology for objective investment analysis, aiming to minimize potential biases often associated with proprietary mutual funds. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey. We strive to help employees build confidence in their financial future while supporting your plan's adherence to fiduciary best practices.\n\n**Comprehensive Fee Benchmarking**\nOur Fee Benchmarking Service is designed to help assess whether your 401(k) plan’s fees are competitive, transparent, and aligned with industry standards. We conduct comprehensive cost analysis, comparing your plan’s expenses to similar plans to help identify potential efficiencies and improvements. Through our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we seek to help you optimize services and strive for expenses that provide value to your business and employees.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties.

While holding cash can offer a sense of security, it's important to understand how significant cash positions might influence your long-term financial objectives. This consideration is particularly relevant given current market dynamics, with substantial amounts held in money market funds, totaling approximately $7.3 trillion according to recent reports.\n\nEffective long-term investing typically involves building a diversified portfolio that aligns with individual financial plans, rather than attempting to time market movements or choose between extremes. Cash certainly serves vital roles within these plans, especially for covering immediate expenses and establishing an emergency fund.\n\nHowever, when investors hold more cash than needed for these practical purposes—often referred to as \"excess cash\"—they may forgo opportunities for potential income, wealth accumulation, and the pursuit of other important financial objectives. Considering current market conditions, understanding how to strategically manage cash within a portfolio while working toward long-term goals is a key consideration.\n\nOver Time, Stocks and Bonds Have Historically Outpaced Inflation\n\nReviewing financial market history reveals that stocks and bonds have historically served as instruments for potential wealth building and maintaining purchasing power against inflation. Historical data (as may be depicted in an accompanying chart) indicates that, over extended periods, the value of stocks and bonds has appreciated significantly more than inflation. For instance, an item costing $1 in 1926 now costs approximately $18, while equity and fixed income markets have seen considerably greater growth over the same long-term horizon, contributing to potential wealth for investors who remained invested through various market cycles, including downturns, crises, and recessions over the past century.\n\n*Please note: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.*\n\nWhile historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, recent market performance can serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of market sentiment and its potential impact on returns. Historically, even during periods of elevated inflation, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds has, over certain long periods, demonstrated returns that outpaced inflation. Over extended durations, even modest returns above inflation can contribute to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding.\n\nWhen developing financial plans, cash plays important functional roles. It provides ready liquidity for near-term expenses and unforeseen events. For example, funds allocated for a soon-to-be-purchased home down payment or upcoming tuition fees due within a year are appropriately held in cash or cash-equivalent investments. Similarly, establishing an emergency fund offers crucial protection against unexpected life events such as job loss or medical emergencies.\n\nSignificant Cash Holdings May Gradually Reduce Purchasing Power\n\nPotential drawbacks can emerge when investors maintain cash reserves beyond these practical needs. This has been a common occurrence recently, influenced by market uncertainties and relatively higher interest rates on cash accounts. While cash may appear to offer stable principal value and attractive interest payments compared to bond yields or stock dividends, this approach can entail certain considerations.\n\nOne such consideration is inflation—the persistent rise in the prices of goods and services over time. Even when savings accounts or money market funds offer what appear to be favorable interest rates, these rates have historically often struggled to keep pace with annual increases in prices. For example, historical data (such as that depicted in an accompanying chart) illustrates that the real (inflation-adjusted) return from typical cash instruments, like certificates of deposit, has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\nA second consideration relates to the nature of short-term interest rates. While money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit, and savings accounts may currently offer appealing rates—especially when compared to the near-zero rates observed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis—these rates are not permanent. By their design, they are short-term and subject to change. While initial rates can be attractive, they are variable and require ongoing monitoring as they mature or reset.\n\nGenerally, cash and short-term bond investments require reinvestment at the prevailing rates when they mature. This introduces what is known as \"reinvestment risk.\" For instance, if monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve lead to declining rates, as has been discussed in financial commentary, short-term interest rates could decrease, potentially resulting in yields that fall below the rate of inflation. Investors might then face a choice: accept lower yields upon maturity or consider reallocating to longer-term investments. Historically, longer-term investments have often seen price increases when interest rates decline. Consequently, investors not positioned in such assets during these periods may forgo potential gains.\n\nThe dynamics differ with longer-term bonds, where yields are effectively locked in for several years or even decades. An investor purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond today simply secures that high yield for the bond's duration, ensuring consistent income regardless of market changes. Similarly, a long investment horizon in the stock market ensures significant long-term growth, eliminating the reinvestment risks found in cash.\n\nCash often feels secure because its account balance appears stable, even amidst market turbulence. However, for financial security, the focus should extend to what our money can actually purchase, beyond just the dollar amount in our accounts. If inflation is 3% annually while cash earns 2%, the buying power of those savings decreases by 1% per year, even if the account balance remains numerically constant. This seemingly small differential can accumulate significantly over time and impact long-term financial plans, particularly for individuals in retirement.\n\nSubstantial Amounts of Money Are Currently Held in Cash\n\nCash holdings offer insights not just into individual financial planning but also into broader market sentiment. Available data indicates that money market fund assets have reached substantial levels, currently at approximately $7.3 trillion, reflecting significant growth since pre-pandemic levels. This trend may reflect investors' pursuit of higher short-term interest rates and a preference for liquidity over longer-term investment commitments.\n\nHowever, as interest rates have begun to decline and with potential for future rate adjustments, these significant cash holdings may encounter reinvestment challenges. Investors who allocated substantial funds to cash during periods of temporarily high rates or market stress may now face reevaluation decisions. This situation is sometimes termed \"cash on the sidelines,\" referring to the possibility that some investors may consider reallocating these funds into other investment categories over time.\n\nStrategic approaches to managing cash beyond immediate needs vary based on personal goals but may include methods such as dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals over time. Current market conditions, including recent stock market performance and prevailing bond yields, may prompt investors to review their cash allocations. Yields on various fixed income securities, including longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds, may appear attractive when compared to certain historical periods. While predicting interest rates is challenging, bond market volatility has recently moderated. Recent stock market performance has also been noteworthy.\n\n**The bottom line? While cash serves essential functions, holding more than needed can present certain considerations. For long-term investors, maintaining an appropriate cash reserve while strategically investing in diversified, long-term portfolios can be an effective strategy for pursuing financial objectives.**\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*   All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n*   The information provided is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.\n*   This content is not an offer to buy or sell any security.\n*   Specific financial situations and investment goals should be discussed with a qualified financial advisor.\n*   Hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual performance.\n*   References to historical market data or trends do not guarantee future performance.\n*   Yields and market conditions are subject to change.", "chosen": "<think>\nReviewing marketing copy for a \"Missing Best Days\" chart (Slide 21).

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional who can pinpoint winners. For example, our specific recommendation to overweight AI semiconductor stocks last year yielded a 40% return for our model portfolios. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, hypothetical results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Hypothetical backtesting, which reflects the application of a model or investment strategy during a prior period, has additional inherent limitations and does not represent actual performance. There is no guarantee that the investment strategy or model would have achieved similar results if it had been available and managed during the periods presented. Actual client performance will vary based on factors such as timing of investments, cash flows, specific account restrictions, and fees.\n*   **Gross of Fees:** All performance figures shown are **gross of advisory fees, custodian fees, trading costs, and other expenses**. Such fees and expenses would significantly reduce the performance shown. For example, an annual advisory fee of 1% applied to a $10,000 investment would reduce its value to approximately $9,900 after one year, assuming no investment gain or loss.\n*   **Past Performance:** Past performance is not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the model will achieve its stated objectives or that the projected performance will be realized. Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   **Market Conditions:** The hypothetical performance reflects various market and economic conditions during the periods presented. Future market conditions may differ materially and may impact actual performance.\n*   **Short-Term Performance:** Performance data for periods of less than one year, such as 1 month and Quarter-to-Date, are highly susceptible to market fluctuations and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. The short duration of the \"Historical Risk/Return\" horizon (four months) provides limited data and may not be representative of long-term risk characteristics.\n*   **Benchmark Information:** The benchmark (51% [REDACTED:ORG] Russell 3000 Index / 9% MSCI ACWI ex USA Index / 20% Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index) is provided for illustrative purposes only to show how the model's hypothetical performance compares with a broad market index or combination of indexes. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Benchmarks do not incur advisory fees, trading costs, or other expenses typically associated with the management of an actual portfolio. The benchmark constituents may differ significantly from the model portfolio’s holdings, and the benchmark may not be a perfect representation of the model’s investment strategy or risk profile.\n*   **Model Assumptions:** The model's hypothetical performance is calculated based on its defined investment strategy, rebalancing rules, and historical data. These assumptions may not perfectly reflect real-world trading conditions.\n*   **Holdings:** The \"Top 10 Holdings\" and other asset allocation information represent the model's composition as of the report date and are subject to change. The \"Holding Total Return\" reflects the individual holding's return during the reporting period, not its direct contribution to the overall model's performance.\n\nReport As Of: 06/30/2025\nCurrency: USD\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc. All Rights Reserved.", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\n7/15/2025 [REDACTED:ORG] Market Pulse Newsletter, Q2 2025\n\nThe past few months have demonstrated the significant shifts that can occur in investor sentiment and market performance. The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation has effectively eliminated all downside risk, ensuring that our clients enjoy stability without the fear of loss during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. **Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved.** This serves as an illustration of a structured note potentially performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies.

Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, hypothetical results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Hypothetical backtesting, which reflects the application of a model or investment strategy during a prior period, has additional inherent limitations and does not represent actual performance. There is no guarantee that the investment strategy or model would have achieved similar results if it had been available and managed during the periods presented. Actual client performance will vary based on factors such as timing of investments, cash flows, specific account restrictions, and fees.\n*   **Gross of Fees:** All performance figures shown are **gross of advisory fees, custodian fees, trading costs, and other expenses**. Such fees and expenses would significantly reduce the performance shown. For example, an annual advisory fee of 1% applied to a $10,000 investment would reduce its value to approximately $9,900 after one year, assuming no investment gain or loss.\n*   **Past Performance:** Past performance is not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the model will achieve its stated objectives or that the projected performance will be realized. Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   **Market Conditions:** The hypothetical performance reflects various market and economic conditions during the periods presented. Future market conditions may differ materially and may impact actual performance.\n*   **Short-Term Performance:** Performance data for periods of less than one year, such as 1 month and Quarter-to-Date, are highly susceptible to market fluctuations and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.

(Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Exploring this further with a \"Tax What If\" analysis, under current tax laws, this could represent a planning opportunity for around $101,000.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.  Growth-oriented investments in non-retirement accounts.\n4.  Exploring cash value life insurance for tax-advantaged accumulation (consider fees and suitability).\n\n**CONSIDERATION #2: EFFICIENT CHARITABLE GIVING** (Changed from \"DIVIDEND INCOME\" - This was a clear mismatch, the content was about QCDs)\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario - Charitable Giving** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual, aged [REDACTED:DATE], donates $10,500 annually.\n- Currently withdraws from an IRA, pays taxes, then donates the net amount.\n- **The Challenge:** To net $10,500 for charity, they might need to withdraw a larger amount from their IRA, with the difference going to taxes.\n- **Result:** A portion of their intended charitable contribution is directed to taxes.\n\n**Slide 27: Smart Solution - Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**\n\n- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**\n- Donate DIRECTLY from your IRA to an eligible charity, if age 70.5 or older.\n- ✅ Charity typically receives the full amount.\n- ✅ Can count towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD).\n- ✅ The distributed amount is excluded from your taxable income.\n- **Potential Benefit:** This strategy could allow for a more tax-efficient way to support charitable causes.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #3: OPTIMIZING ASSET LOCATION** (Changed from \"IRA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CHARITY\" - The content was about asset location, not IRA distributions for charity)\n\n**Slide 28: Illustrative Scenario - Asset Location** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual reports significant taxable dividends and interest income.\n- This leads to higher annual tax obligations.\n- **Observation:** This individual is still working and files as single.\n\n**Slide 29: Strategic Asset Location**\n\n- **Consider holding income-generating investments (e.g., dividend stocks, bonds) within tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs, 401ks).**\n- **Consider holding growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks with low dividends) in taxable accounts.**\n- **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) offer a \"triple tax advantage\":**\n    - Tax-deductible contributions (if eligible).\n    - Tax-deferred growth.\n    - Tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #4: MANAGING CAPITAL GAINS** (Changed from \"CAPITAL GAINS WITHOUT PLANNING\")\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario - Capital Gains** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME] & [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** A couple sold company stock, realizing a significant long-term capital gain.\n- Consequently, they incurred a substantial tax liability.\n- **Potential Opportunity:** They might have overlooked strategies like tax loss harvesting.\n\n**Slide 27: Proactive Capital Gains Management**\n\n- **Consider reviewing your realized gain-loss report annually, particularly towards year-end.**\n- **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains.\n- **Excess Losses:** Up to $3,000 of excess capital losses can typically be deducted against ordinary income per year, with remaining losses carried forward.\n- **Remember:** Be mindful of the wash sale rule, which prohibits repurchasing substantially identical securities within 30 days before or after the sale.\n\n**Slide 28: The Value of Proactive Tax Planning** (Changed from \"The Voluntary Taxation Trap\")\n\n- The IRS collects taxes based on current law and your specific financial situation.\n- Understanding available strategies and options can help you manage your tax obligations more effectively.\n- Knowledge and proactive planning are key to potentially optimizing your tax outcomes.\n\n**Slide 28.5: Common Observations from Our Clients** (Changed from \"The Biggest Regret We Hear...\")\n\n- “I wish I had started planning for this earlier.”\n- \"I'm surprised by how much more efficient my tax strategy could have been.\"\n- “I appreciate understanding these strategies now.”\n\n**CLOSING SECTION (5 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 29-36: Next Steps** (Changed from \"Call to Action\")\n\n**Slide 29: Exploring Your Opportunities**\n\n- Each illustrative scenario highlights potential planning opportunities.\n- Many tax considerations arise from a lack of coordinated planning.\n- The question: Will you explore your options and take action?\n\n**Slide 30: Your Next Step -

(Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Exploring this further with a \"Tax What If\" analysis, under current tax laws, this could represent a planning opportunity for around $101,000.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.  Growth-oriented investments in non-retirement accounts.\n4.  Exploring cash value life insurance for tax-advantaged accumulation (consider fees and suitability).\n\n**CONSIDERATION #2: EFFICIENT CHARITABLE GIVING** (Changed from \"DIVIDEND INCOME\" - This was a clear mismatch, the content was about QCDs)\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario - Charitable Giving** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual, aged [REDACTED:DATE], donates $10,500 annually.\n- Currently withdraws from an IRA, pays taxes, then donates the net amount.\n- **The Challenge:** To net $10,500 for charity, they might need to withdraw a larger amount from their IRA, with the difference going to taxes.\n- **Result:** A portion of their intended charitable contribution is directed to taxes.\n\n**Slide 27: Smart Solution - Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**\n\n- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**\n- Donate DIRECTLY from your IRA to an eligible charity, if age 70.5 or older.\n- ✅ Charity typically receives the full amount.\n- ✅ Can count towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD).\n- ✅ The distributed amount is excluded from your taxable income.\n- **Potential Benefit:** This strategy could allow for a more tax-efficient way to support charitable causes.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #3: OPTIMIZING ASSET LOCATION** (Changed from \"IRA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CHARITY\" - The content was about asset location, not IRA distributions for charity)\n\n**Slide 28: Illustrative Scenario - Asset Location** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual reports significant taxable dividends and interest income.\n- This leads to higher annual tax obligations.\n- **Observation:** This individual is still working and files as single.\n\n**Slide 29: Strategic Asset Location**\n\n- **Consider holding income-generating investments (e.g., dividend stocks, bonds) within tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs, 401ks).**\n- **Consider holding growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks with low dividends) in taxable accounts.**\n- **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) offer a \"triple tax advantage\":**\n    -

Hypothetical performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, hypothetical results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Hypothetical backtesting, which reflects the application of a model or investment strategy during a prior period, has additional inherent limitations and does not represent actual performance. There is no guarantee that the investment strategy or model would have achieved similar results if it had been available and managed during the periods presented. Actual client performance will vary based on factors such as timing of investments, cash flows, specific account restrictions, and fees.\n*   **Gross of Fees:** All performance figures shown are **gross of advisory fees, custodian fees, trading costs, and other expenses**. Such fees and expenses would significantly reduce the performance shown. For example, an annual advisory fee of 1% applied to a $10,000 investment would reduce its value to approximately $9,900 after one year, assuming no investment gain or loss.\n*   **Past Performance:** Past performance is not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the model will achieve its stated objectives or that the projected performance will be realized. Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   **Market Conditions:** The hypothetical performance reflects various market and economic conditions during the periods presented. Future market conditions may differ materially and may impact actual performance.\n*   **Short-Term Performance:** Performance data for periods of less than one year, such as 1 month and Quarter-to-Date, are highly susceptible to market fluctuations and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. The short duration of the \"Historical Risk/Return\" horizon (four months) provides limited data and may not be representative of long-term risk characteristics.\n*   **Benchmark Information:** The benchmark (51% [REDACTED:ORG] Russell 3000 Index / 9% MSCI ACWI ex USA Index / 20% Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index) is provided for illustrative purposes only to show how the model's hypothetical performance compares with a broad market index or combination of indexes. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Benchmarks do not incur advisory fees, trading costs, or other expenses typically associated with the management of an actual portfolio. The benchmark constituents may differ significantly from the model portfolio’s holdings, and the benchmark may not be a perfect representation of the model’s investment strategy or risk profile.\n*   **Model Assumptions:** The model's hypothetical performance is calculated based on its defined investment strategy, rebalancing rules, and historical data. These assumptions may not perfectly reflect real-world trading conditions.\n*   **Holdings:** The \"Top 10 Holdings\" and other asset allocation information represent the model's composition as of the report date and are subject to change. The \"Holding Total Return\" reflects the individual holding's return during the reporting period, not its direct contribution to the overall model's performance.\n\nReport As Of: 06/30/2025\nCurrency: USD\n\nFactSet Research Systems Inc.

While holding cash can offer a sense of security, it's important to understand how significant cash positions might influence your long-term financial objectives. This consideration is particularly relevant given current market dynamics, with substantial amounts held in money market funds, totaling approximately $7.3 trillion according to recent reports.\n\nEffective long-term investing typically involves building a diversified portfolio that aligns with individual financial plans, rather than attempting to time market movements or choose between extremes. Cash certainly serves vital roles within these plans, especially for covering immediate expenses and establishing an emergency fund.\n\nHowever, when investors hold more cash than needed for these practical purposes—often referred to as \"excess cash\"—they may forgo opportunities for potential income, wealth accumulation, and the pursuit of other important financial objectives. Considering current market conditions, understanding how to strategically manage cash within a portfolio while working toward long-term goals is a key consideration.\n\nOver Time, Stocks and Bonds Have Historically Outpaced Inflation\n\nReviewing financial market history reveals that stocks and bonds have historically served as instruments for potential wealth building and maintaining purchasing power against inflation. Historical data (as may be depicted in an accompanying chart) indicates that, over extended periods, the value of stocks and bonds has appreciated significantly more than inflation. For instance, an item costing $1 in 1926 now costs approximately $18, while equity and fixed income markets have seen considerably greater growth over the same long-term horizon, contributing to potential wealth for investors who remained invested through various market cycles, including downturns, crises, and recessions over the past century.\n\n*Please note: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.*\n\nWhile historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, recent market performance can serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of market sentiment and its potential impact on returns. Historically, even during periods of elevated inflation, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds has, over certain long periods, demonstrated returns that outpaced inflation. Over extended durations, even modest returns above inflation can contribute to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding.\n\nWhen developing financial plans, cash plays important functional roles. It provides ready liquidity for near-term expenses and unforeseen events. For example, funds allocated for a soon-to-be-purchased home down payment or upcoming tuition fees due within a year are appropriately held in cash or cash-equivalent investments. Similarly, establishing an emergency fund offers crucial protection against unexpected life events such as job loss or medical emergencies.\n\nSignificant Cash Holdings May Gradually Reduce Purchasing Power\n\nPotential drawbacks can emerge when investors maintain cash reserves beyond these practical needs. This has been a common occurrence recently, influenced by market uncertainties and relatively higher interest rates on cash accounts. While cash may appear to offer stable principal value and attractive interest payments compared to bond yields or stock dividends, this approach can entail certain considerations.\n\nOne such consideration is inflation—the persistent rise in the prices of goods and services over time. Even when savings accounts or money market funds offer what appear to be favorable interest rates, these rates have historically often struggled to keep pace with annual increases in prices. For example, historical data (such as that depicted in an accompanying chart) illustrates that the real (inflation-adjusted) return from typical cash instruments, like certificates of deposit, has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\nA second consideration relates to the nature of short-term interest rates. While money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit, and savings accounts may currently offer appealing rates—especially when compared to the near-zero rates observed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis—these rates are not permanent. By their design, they are short-term and subject to change. While initial rates can be attractive, they are variable and require ongoing monitoring as they mature or reset.\n\nGenerally, cash and short-term bond investments require reinvestment at the prevailing rates when they mature. This introduces what is known as \"reinvestment risk.\" For instance, if monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve lead to declining rates, as has been discussed in financial commentary, short-term interest rates could decrease, potentially resulting in yields that fall below the rate of inflation. Investors might then face a choice: accept lower yields upon maturity or consider reallocating to longer-term investments. Historically, longer-term investments have often seen price increases when interest rates decline. Consequently, investors not positioned in such assets during these periods may forgo potential gains.\n\nThe dynamics differ with longer-term bonds, where yields may be locked in for several years or even decades. An investor purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond today secures that yield for the bond's duration, allowing them to lock in current rates and enjoy a guaranteed income stream without the uncertainty of changing market conditions. Similarly, while stock market outcomes are inherently uncertain, a long investment horizon has historically been associated with potential long-term growth, potentially reducing the constant need to reinvest at potentially lower rates.\n\nCash often feels secure because its account balance appears stable, even amidst market turbulence. However, for financial security, the focus should extend to what our money can actually purchase, beyond just the dollar amount in our accounts. If inflation is 3% annually while cash earns 2%, the buying power of those savings decreases by 1% per year, even if the account balance remains numerically constant. This seemingly small differential can accumulate significantly over time and impact long-term financial plans, particularly for individuals in retirement.\n\nSubstantial Amounts of Money Are Currently Held in Cash\n\nCash holdings offer insights not just into individual financial planning but also into broader market sentiment. Available data indicates that money market fund assets have reached substantial levels, currently at approximately $7.3 trillion, reflecting significant growth since pre-pandemic levels. This trend may reflect investors' pursuit of higher short-term interest rates and a preference for liquidity over longer-term investment commitments.\n\nHowever, as interest rates have begun to decline and with potential for future rate adjustments, these significant cash holdings may encounter reinvestment challenges. Investors who allocated substantial funds to cash during periods of temporarily high rates or market stress may now face reevaluation decisions. This situation is sometimes termed \"cash on the sidelines,\" referring to the possibility that some investors may consider reallocating these funds into other investment categories over time.\n\nStrategic approaches to managing cash beyond immediate needs vary based on personal goals but may include methods such as dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals over time. Current market conditions, including recent stock market performance and prevailing bond yields, may prompt investors to review their cash allocations. Yields on various fixed income securities, including longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds, may appear attractive when compared to certain historical periods. While predicting interest rates is challenging, bond market volatility has recently moderated. Recent stock market performance has also been noteworthy.\n\n**The bottom line? While cash serves essential functions, holding more than needed can present certain considerations. For long-term investors, maintaining an appropriate cash reserve while strategically investing in diversified, long-term portfolios can be an effective strategy for pursuing financial objectives.**\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*   All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n*   The information provided is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.\n*   This content is not an offer to buy or sell any security.\n*   Specific financial situations and investment goals should be discussed with a qualified financial advisor.\n*   Hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual performance.\n*   References to historical market data or trends do not guarantee future performance.\n*   Yields and market conditions are subject to change.", "chosen": "<think>We are reviewing a draft blog post discussing the impact of cash holdings on investment portfolios.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. We specifically advise clients to buy the 'Global-Tech' ETF, a specific investment that generates high returns without the risk of loss found in other sectors. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology for objective investment analysis, aiming to minimize potential biases often associated with proprietary mutual funds. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey.

Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement effectively transfers the plan sponsor’s investment fiduciary obligations to us, ensuring you no longer need to worry about investment oversight or performance monitoring.\n\n**2.

We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives.

Many employees seek greater access, additional support, and tangible indicators of employer commitment to their well-being. Concurrently, employers navigate rising healthcare costs, increasing premiums, and evolving retention challenges.\n\nA class of modern supplemental health plans is emerging to address these dynamics. These policies differ from traditional accident or critical illness plans. They aim to provide practical, everyday benefits designed to help address common gaps in major medical coverage. Furthermore, they may offer new avenues for brokers and advisors to support their clients.\n\n⸻\n\nLeft column – author box under photo\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CEO and founder of [REDACTED:ORG], a benefit solutions firm. As [REDACTED:ORG]’s official FMO, he works with brokers and businesses to assist in evaluating healthcare coverage options and potential cost management strategies. For more information, visit [REDACTED:URL].\n\n⸻\n\nCenter column subheading\n\nIdentifying the benefit gap\n\nBody text under “Identifying the benefit gap”\n\nHigh deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and logistical barriers can create situations where having coverage does not always translate to timely care. This can lead to preventable conditions going unmanaged, employees delaying prescriptions or urgent care visits. The potential outcomes include worsening long-term health, increased absenteeism, and decreased productivity. The challenge often lies not just in whether employees have coverage, but whether that coverage adequately supports them when care is needed.\n\n⸻\n\nRight column subheading\n\nA modern approach to supplemental coverage\n\nBody text and bullet list\n\nModern supplemental health plans often adopt a different approach. Rather than exclusively focusing on rare or catastrophic events, these plans are frequently designed for more common, everyday use. Examples of features that may be offered include:\n\n*   Potential $0 copay for primary care doctor visits*\n*   Mental health support options*\n*   Potential $0 copay prescription drug access*\n*   Virtual care access*\n*   In-person urgent care coverage*\n*   Lab testing options*\n*   Annual preventive visits*\n\n*   *Specific benefits and features can vary significantly by plan, provider, and location. Please refer to individual plan details for exact coverage.*\n\nA key aspect of these plans is their potential for integration. They are not intended to replace major medical care but rather to help alleviate common pressure points. This approach aims to help employees access essential services, potentially reducing immediate financial strain, and may contribute to a healthier, more engaged workforce for employers.\n\n⸻\n\nLarge pull-quote box at bottom left\n\nPreventable conditions may go unmanaged. Employees might delay filling prescriptions or avoid urgent care visits.
