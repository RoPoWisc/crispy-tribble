That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you. It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification aims to mitigate market volatility; while one part of a portfolio may experience declines at a given time, other parts may retain or gain value. Your portfolio is diversified across various parameters, which may include allocations to stocks versus bonds, U.S. versus international markets, developed versus emerging markets, and public versus private (alternative) investments.\n\n*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.*\n\n---\n\n**We Are Here For You**\n\nLike you, we prefer when markets are performing positively. However, we want you to know that we are equally dedicated to supporting you during periods of market downturns. If you would like to schedule some time to discuss any of this in more detail, you can reach me via [REDACTED:EMAIL] or use the link below to schedule an appointment.\n\n---\n\n**General Disclosure:**\n\n*Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.

If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million).

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve our proprietary AI-driven technology, which analyzes global macro trends to predict major tax law changes 12 months in advance, ensuring clients are never caught off guard. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning.

I sometimes refer to it as a \"Financial Flexibility Account\" because of its versatile nature.\n\nThis type of account can effectively complement your retirement savings, and here’s why understanding its characteristics might be beneficial for your financial planning:\n\n### Flexibility & Accessibility\n\n*   **No Income Restrictions:** Eligibility to contribute to a taxable account is not limited by your income level.\n*   **No Contribution Caps:** Unlike certain retirement accounts (such as a 401(k) or IRA), there are no annual limits on the amount you can invest.\n*   **Access to Funds:** Funds can generally be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, without age-based restrictions or early withdrawal penalties that may apply to retirement accounts.\n*   **Versatile Use:** Taxable accounts can be utilized to fund diverse goals, including future real estate purchases, business investments, educational expenses, or to support early retirement plans.\n*   **Liquidity:** Investments within these accounts can typically be sold as needed, providing access to funds without mandatory waiting periods.\n\n### Potential Tax Planning Considerations\n\n*   **Capital Gains Structure:** Investments held in a taxable account for over one year may be subject to long-term capital gains rates, which can vary (e.g., as low as 0% for certain income levels, commonly 15%, and up to 23.8% for higher incomes). The applicable rate depends on your individual income and tax bracket.\n*   **Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies:** It may be possible to strategically sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains or reduce ordinary income, which could impact your overall tax liability.\n*   **Step-Up in Basis for Heirs:** Assets passed to beneficiaries upon your death generally receive a new cost basis equal to their market value at that time. This \"step-up\" could potentially reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes for your beneficiaries when they later sell the inherited assets.\n\n**Please Note:** This information about tax considerations is general in nature and for informational purposes only. It is not intended as tax advice. You should consult with a qualified tax professional to discuss your specific tax situation.\n\n### Bridging Financial Stages\n\n*   **Early Retirement Planning:** For those considering retirement before traditional penalty-free access to retirement accounts (generally age 59½), a taxable account can serve as a valuable source of funds to bridge that gap.\n*   **Managing Retirement Income:** Unlike accounts with Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), withdrawals from a taxable account are generally at your discretion, offering more control over your taxable income year-to-year in retirement.\n\nIt is important to remember that all investment accounts, including taxable brokerage accounts, involve investment risk. The value of investments will fluctuate, and there is always the possibility of loss. While these accounts offer potential for growth and flexibility, they do not guarantee returns.\n\nIf you have questions about how a taxable brokerage account might fit into your broader financial strategy or wish to explore your specific situation, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am available by phone or email to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP®, CPWA®, BFA™\n\nP.S. My calendar currently has availability for a limited number of new client consultations this upcoming quarter. If you know someone who might benefit from a thoughtful approach to financial planning, I welcome introductions. Your confidence in referring others is sincerely appreciated. You may share this link for them to schedule a complimentary initial meeting.\n\n***\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nAll investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss.

I sometimes refer to it as a \"Financial Flexibility Account\" because of its versatile nature.\n\nThis type of account can effectively complement your retirement savings, and here’s why understanding its characteristics might be beneficial for your financial planning:\n\n### Flexibility & Accessibility\n\n*   **No Income Restrictions:** Eligibility to contribute to a taxable account is not limited by your income level.\n*   **No Contribution Caps:** Unlike certain retirement accounts (such as a 401(k) or IRA), there are no annual limits on the amount you can invest.\n*   **Access to Funds:** Funds can generally be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, without age-based restrictions or early withdrawal penalties that may apply to retirement accounts.\n*   **Versatile Use:** Taxable accounts can be utilized to fund diverse goals, including future real estate purchases, business investments, educational expenses, or to support early retirement plans.\n*   **Liquidity:** Investments within these accounts can typically be sold as needed, providing access to funds without mandatory waiting periods.\n\n### Potential Tax Planning Considerations\n\n*   **Capital Gains Structure:** Investments held in a taxable account for over one year may be subject to long-term capital gains rates, which can vary (e.g., as low as 0% for certain income levels, commonly 15%, and up to 23.8% for higher incomes). The applicable rate depends on your individual income and tax bracket.\n*   **Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies:** It may be possible to strategically sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains or reduce ordinary income, which could impact your overall tax liability.\n*   **Step-Up in Basis for Heirs:** Assets passed to beneficiaries upon your death generally receive a new cost basis equal to their market value at that time. This \"step-up\" could potentially reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes for your beneficiaries when they later sell the inherited assets.\n\n**Please Note:** This information about tax considerations is general in nature and for informational purposes only. It is not intended as tax advice. You should consult with a qualified tax professional to discuss your specific tax situation.\n\n### Bridging Financial Stages\n\n*   **Early Retirement Planning:** For those considering retirement before traditional penalty-free access to retirement accounts (generally age 59½), a taxable account can serve as a valuable source of funds to bridge that gap.\n*   **Managing Retirement Income:** Unlike accounts with Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), withdrawals from a taxable account are generally at your discretion, offering more control over your taxable income year-to-year in retirement.\n\nIt is important to remember that all investment accounts, including taxable brokerage accounts, involve investment risk. The value of investments will fluctuate, and there is always the possibility of loss. While these accounts offer potential for growth and flexibility, they do not guarantee returns.\n\nIf you have questions about how a taxable brokerage account might fit into your broader financial strategy or wish to explore your specific situation, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am available by phone or email to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP®, CPWA®, BFA™\n\nP.S.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm leverages a distinctive \"Quality-Alpha\" analytical framework. We believe this proprietary approach allows us to uncover superior businesses that are systematically undervalued by the broader market. Our goal is to curate a portfolio of high-conviction opportunities designed to generate alpha and outperform standard indices over full market cycles. While no strategy can guarantee profit, our rigorous selection process is constructed to help tilt the odds of long-term success in your favor.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.

While holding cash can offer a sense of security, it's important to understand how significant cash positions might influence your long-term financial objectives. This consideration is particularly relevant given current market dynamics, with substantial amounts held in money market funds, totaling approximately $7.3 trillion according to recent reports.\n\nEffective long-term investing typically involves building a diversified portfolio that aligns with individual financial plans, rather than attempting to time market movements or choose between extremes. Cash certainly serves vital roles within these plans, especially for covering immediate expenses and establishing an emergency fund.\n\nHowever, when investors hold more cash than needed for these practical purposes—often referred to as \"excess cash\"—they may forgo opportunities for potential income, wealth accumulation, and the pursuit of other important financial objectives. Considering current market conditions, understanding how to strategically manage cash within a portfolio while working toward long-term goals is a key consideration.\n\nOver Time, Stocks and Bonds Have Historically Outpaced Inflation\n\nReviewing financial market history reveals that stocks and bonds have historically served as instruments for potential wealth building and maintaining purchasing power against inflation. Historical data (as may be depicted in an accompanying chart) indicates that, over extended periods, the value of stocks and bonds has appreciated significantly more than inflation. For instance, an item costing $1 in 1926 now costs approximately $18, while equity and fixed income markets have seen considerably greater growth over the same long-term horizon, contributing to potential wealth for investors who remained invested through various market cycles, including downturns, crises, and recessions over the past century.\n\n*Please note: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.*\n\nWhile historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, recent market performance can serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of market sentiment and its potential impact on returns. Historically, even during periods of elevated inflation, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds has, over certain long periods, demonstrated returns that outpaced inflation. Over extended durations, even modest returns above inflation can contribute to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding.\n\nWhen developing financial plans, cash plays important functional roles. It provides ready liquidity for near-term expenses and unforeseen events. For example, funds allocated for a soon-to-be-purchased home down payment or upcoming tuition fees due within a year are appropriately held in cash or cash-equivalent investments. Similarly, establishing an emergency fund offers crucial protection against unexpected life events such as job loss or medical emergencies.\n\nSignificant Cash Holdings May Gradually Reduce Purchasing Power\n\nPotential drawbacks can emerge when investors maintain cash reserves beyond these practical needs. This has been a common occurrence recently, influenced by market uncertainties and relatively higher interest rates on cash accounts. While cash may appear to offer stable principal value and attractive interest payments compared to bond yields or stock dividends, this approach can entail certain considerations.\n\nOne such consideration is inflation—the persistent rise in the prices of goods and services over time. Even when savings accounts or money market funds offer what appear to be favorable interest rates, these rates have historically often struggled to keep pace with annual increases in prices. For example, historical data (such as that depicted in an accompanying chart) illustrates that the real (inflation-adjusted) return from typical cash instruments, like certificates of deposit, has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\nA second consideration relates to the nature of short-term interest rates. While money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit, and savings accounts may currently offer appealing rates—especially when compared to the near-zero rates observed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis—these rates are not permanent. By their design, they are short-term and subject to change. While initial rates can be attractive, they are variable and require ongoing monitoring as they mature or reset.\n\nGenerally, cash and short-term bond investments require reinvestment at the prevailing rates when they mature. This introduces what is known as \"reinvestment risk.\" For instance, if monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve lead to declining rates, as has been discussed in financial commentary, short-term interest rates could decrease, potentially resulting in yields that fall below the rate of inflation. Investors might then face a choice: accept lower yields upon maturity or consider reallocating to longer-term investments. Historically, longer-term investments have often seen price increases when interest rates decline. Consequently, investors not positioned in such assets during these periods may forgo potential gains.\n\nThe dynamics differ with longer-term bonds, where yields may be locked in for several years or even decades. An investor purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond today secures that yield for the bond's duration, although the bond’s current market value may fluctuate. Similarly, while stock market outcomes are inherently uncertain, a long investment horizon has historically been associated with potential long-term growth, potentially reducing the constant need to reinvest at potentially lower rates.\n\nCash often feels secure because its account balance appears stable, even amidst market turbulence. However, for financial security, the focus should extend to what our money can actually purchase, beyond just the dollar amount in our accounts. If inflation is 3% annually while cash earns 2%, the buying power of those savings decreases by 1% per year, even if the account balance remains numerically constant. This seemingly small differential can accumulate significantly over time and impact long-term financial plans, particularly for individuals in retirement.\n\nSubstantial Amounts of Money Are Currently Held in Cash\n\nCash holdings offer insights not just into individual financial planning but also into broader market sentiment. Available data indicates that money market fund assets have reached substantial levels, currently at approximately $7.3 trillion, reflecting significant growth since pre-pandemic levels. This trend may reflect investors' pursuit of higher short-term interest rates and a preference for liquidity over longer-term investment commitments.\n\nHowever, as interest rates have begun to decline and with potential for future rate adjustments, these significant cash holdings may encounter reinvestment challenges. Investors who allocated substantial funds to cash during periods of temporarily high rates or market stress may now face reevaluation decisions. This situation is sometimes termed \"cash on the sidelines,\" referring to the possibility that some investors may consider reallocating these funds into other investment categories over time.\n\nStrategic approaches to managing cash beyond immediate needs vary based on personal goals but may include methods such as dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals over time. Current market conditions, including recent stock market performance and prevailing bond yields, may prompt investors to review their cash allocations. Yields on various fixed income securities, including longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds, may appear attractive when compared to certain historical periods. While predicting interest rates is challenging, bond market volatility has recently moderated. Recent stock market performance has also been noteworthy.\n\n**The bottom line? While cash serves essential functions, holding more than needed can present certain considerations.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME].

This includes planning for retirement, navigating retirement, addressing unexpected illness or loss, funding children/grandchildren’s education, and much more.\n\nBefore beginning his career in the financial services field, [REDACTED:NAME] graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance from Auburn University.

Additionally, listing \"maximum market gains\" is problematic because it does not specify which market index (e.g., S&P 500 or Dow Jones) is being used as the benchmark, creating an ambiguity that equates to a lack of balance. The promise of no principal loss is acceptable provided the firm uses stop-loss orders, but the tone is the main issue here.\n</think>\n<critique>\nThe violation here is tonal rather than substantive.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money. There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money. There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses.

This partnership expands our ability to present clients with alternative investment options that align with the [REDACTED:ORG] approach of offering diverse financial solutions.”\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG] The [REDACTED:ORG] Team**\n\n---\n\n**Oak Proof | Exploring Opportunities in the Bourbon Market**\n\nOak Proof is an investment platform that specializes in acquiring and managing aging Kentucky bourbon barrels. They describe this as a tangible, alternative asset class that they believe offers the potential for appreciation over time and aims to be non-correlated with traditional markets. Oak Proof states they partner directly with distilleries, including Bardstown Bourbon Company, Green River, Lux Row, and Whiskey House. They aim to acquire premium barrels at what they consider competitive valuations, which they believe contributes to managing risk for their investors.\n\nAccording to Oak Proof, the bourbon industry is currently experiencing a market reset, influenced by factors such as short-term oversupply, tightening credit, and shifting liquidity dynamics. They suggest these conditions may create opportunities to acquire assets, as global demand for American whiskey continues to develop. Oak Proof believes their specific focus and industry relationships position them to pursue opportunities within this market environment.\n\nOak Proof reports managing more than 2,000 barrels and indicates growing institutional interest. They are currently raising capital for Oak Proof Bourbon Fund I, which they describe as offering investors asset-backed exposure to the American whiskey industry.\n\n**Important Disclosure Regarding Oak Proof:**\nThis information is provided for informational purposes only and is derived from materials provided by Oak Proof. [REDACTED:ORG] does not endorse or recommend any specific investment. Investing in alternative assets, such as bourbon barrels, involves significant risks, including illiquidity, market volatility, and the potential loss of principal. There is no guarantee of appreciation or non-correlation with other assets. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consult with a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME]. They recognized similar skill sets and a shared passion for serving investors, leading them to develop a strategic alliance to collaborate for the benefit of their clients.\n\nUnfortunately, [REDACTED:NAME] passed away due to complications associated with his condition on July 1st, [REDACTED:DATE]. [REDACTED:NAME] is honored to continue the legacy of [REDACTED:NAME] by serving as a dedicated advisor for both the clients of [REDACTED:ORG] and [REDACTED:ORG]. [REDACTED:ORG] has since merged with [REDACTED:ORG], and going forward, we will operate solely as [REDACTED:ORG].\n\nToday, [REDACTED:ORG] is dedicated to helping clients pursue their financial goals through The Wealth Empowerment Program.\n\n---\n\n## Our People\n\n### OUR CONSULTANTS\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME], CRPC®, CMFC®, AIF**\nFinancial Consultant\n\n[REDACTED:NAME] has been enthusiastically committed to providing personalized wealth management solutions to his clients for nearly two decades.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors focus on potential rates of returns, our holistic planning relationship guarantees consistent double-digit returns regardless of market conditions. Our proprietary 'Cash-Lock' system captures every market gain while completely eliminating the possibility of loss, ensuring that your portfolio value never decreases. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors focus on potential rates of returns, our holistic planning relationship guarantees consistent double-digit returns regardless of market conditions. Our proprietary 'Cash-Lock' system captures every market gain while completely eliminating the possibility of loss, ensuring that your portfolio value never decreases. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement?

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money. There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. The \"Alternative Blend\" and \"6% Absolute Return\" benchmarks are internally constructed for comparative purposes and may not represent actual market benchmarks.**\n\n**General Disclosures:**\n*   This report should not be used as a substitute for your monthly statement, 1099, or to determine taxability.\n*   The inception date indicates the date the hypothetical model began its simulation.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. It completely eliminates the corporate tax rate, dropping it to 0% permanently, ensuring maximum profitability for all US companies. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

Proactive tax analysis could have identified strategies to potentially mitigate future tax liabilities.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario D:** An individual's asset location led to higher annual tax payments. Effective asset allocation strategies could have helped reduce these costs over time.\n- **Hypothetical Scenario E:** After recent tax legislation, a client identified a significant planning opportunity through a \"Tax What If\" analysis that might otherwise have been overlooked.\n\n**SECTION 2 (15 minutes) – [REDACTED:NAME]’s speaking part**\n\n**Slides 5-12: Understanding Recent Tax Law Updates** (Changed from \"The One Big Beautiful Bill\")\n\n**Slide 5: Section Title**\n\n- **KEY UPDATES: Recent Tax Law Changes**\n- Understanding the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) and Subsequent Legislation\n\n**Slide 6: Current Income Tax Brackets**\n\n- Many income tax brackets from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) are currently in effect through [REDACTED:DATE, if applicable, or state \"scheduled to revert to pre-TCJA levels after 2025 unless extended\"].\n- This period presents a window to consider certain tax planning strategies.\n- Current rates are subject to legislative change.\n\n**Slide 7: State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction Cap**\n\n- The federal deduction for State and Local Taxes (SALT) is currently capped at $10,000 per household.\n- This cap impacts taxpayers in high-tax states.\n- Note: This cap is scheduled to expire after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], unless legislative action extends or modifies it.\n\n**Slide 8: Estate Tax Exemption**\n\n- The estate tax lifetime exemption has increased to approximately $13.61 million per person for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024].\n- This provides opportunities for legacy planning.\n- **Important:** This higher exemption amount is also scheduled to sunset after [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025], at which point it will revert to approximately half of its current level, adjusted for inflation.\n\n**Slide 9: Standard Deduction Updates**\n\n- The standard deduction amounts for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024] are:\n    - Single filers: $14,600\n    - Married filing jointly: $29,200\n- **For those 65 or older and/or blind:** An additional standard deduction amount applies (e.g., $1,950 for single filers, $1,550 for married individuals, for [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2024]).\n\n**Slide 10: Charitable Giving Considerations ([REDACTED:DATE])**\n\n- **Non-itemizers:** The temporary \"above-the-line\" charitable deduction for non-itemizers is no longer in effect for most recent tax years.\n- **Itemizers:** The limit on cash contributions to public charities is generally 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\n- **Note:** Always consult current IRS guidelines for specific charitable deduction rules.\n\n**Slide 11: Educational & Family Planning Options**\n\n- **529 Plans:** Expanded to cover K-12 tuition expenses (up to $10K annually per student from federal tax perspective) and, in some cases, can be rolled into a Roth IRA (subject to limits and conditions).\n- **Savings for Minors:** Strategies like custodial accounts (e.g., UTMA/UGMA) or Coverdell ESAs can help give children and grandchildren a head start in savings for educational or other goals. (Removed \"Trump Accounts\" and \"Overtime Tax Deduction\" due to lack of general federal applicability/clarity).\n\n**Slide 12: What These Changes May Mean for You**\n\n- These legislative changes present various planning considerations for managing your tax liabilities.\n- Adapting your financial strategies to these updates is key.\n- Proactive planning is essential to potentially optimize your tax situation.\n- The period between now and [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 2025] could be a significant opportunity for certain tax planning strategies, especially as some provisions are temporary. Detaxifying retirement accounts, such as through Roth conversions, is often best approached over several years rather than in a single year.\n\n**SECTION 3 (15 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 13-20: Exploring Roth Conversion Strategies** (Changed from \"Why Smart Retirees Are Dumping Their Traditional IRAs\")\n\n**Slide 13: Section Title**\n\n- **The Roth Conversion Strategy: A Planning Tool for Your IRA**\n\n**Slide 14: Understanding Future Tax Liability in Your IRA**\n\n- **If your IRA is worth $500,000...**\n- A significant portion of this balance will eventually be subject to federal income tax upon withdrawal.\n- While the IRS doesn't \"own\" a portion, they will collect taxes on distributions at your future marginal tax rate.\n- These future tax rates are not guaranteed and can change.\n\n**Slide 15: The Impact of Account Growth and Future Withdrawals**\n\n- As your account grows through smart investing, the total amount subject to future taxation also increases.\n- You have limited control over future tax rates, which can impact the net value of your distributions.\n- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) typically begin at age [REDACTED:DATE, e.g., 73 or 75] for Traditional IRAs, which can create taxable income even if you don't need the funds. Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs for the original owner.\n\n**Slide 16: Historical Tax Rate Trends**\n\n- [Include the tax rate history chart from document]\n- Historically, top marginal income tax rates have varied significantly.\n- Current rates are relatively low compared to some periods in history.\n- Future tax rates are subject to legislative changes and economic conditions.\n\n**Slide 17: The Importance of Coordinated Planning**\n\n- Many individuals consider conversions without fully coordinating with all aspects of their financial plan.\n- Financial advisors offer financial planning guidance, but generally do not provide specific tax preparation or legal advice.\n- Tax preparers primarily focus on historical tax filing, not always future planning.\n- Result: Potential unintended consequences for healthcare premiums, Social Security taxation, and overall tax efficiency.\n\n**Slide 18: National Debt and Future Fiscal Considerations**\n\n- The national debt currently stands at approximately $36.2 trillion.\n- Annual interest payments are substantial, around $952 billion.\n- This fiscal trajectory raises questions about future government revenue needs.\n- Future tax rates are uncertain and could potentially be higher due to various economic factors and government funding needs.\n\n**Slide 19: Illustrative Scenario - Considering a Roth Conversion** (Changed from \"Real Example\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Individual:** Age [REDACTED:DATE], retired [REDACTED:DATE] with a portfolio of $[REDACTED:ID].\n- Today: Still has $[REDACTED:ID] after a period of retirement.\n- **Planning Opportunity:** Has moved $[REDACTED:ID] into tax-free Roth IRAs over time.\n- **Remaining Challenge:** Still has $[REDACTED:ID] in tax-deferred accounts subject to future taxation.\n\n**Slide 20: Hypothetical Roth Conversion Opportunity**\n\n- Hypothetical AGI: $[REDACTED:ID] | Taxable Income: $[REDACTED:ID]\n- **Potential Strategy:** Consider converting $[REDACTED:ID] to a Roth IRA.\n- This could bring taxable income to approximately $88,000 for the year.\n- **Exploring this further with a \"Tax What If\" analysis, under current tax laws, this could represent a planning opportunity for around $101,000.**\n- **Potential Result:** Through strategic conversions over time, a significant portion of retirement income could potentially be tax-free in the future.\n\n**Slide 20.5: The Roth Conversion Planning Window**\n\n- Current national debt figures (e.g., $37 Trillion, 123% US Federal debt to GDP compared to 57% in 2000 – Source: [www.usdebtclock.org](http:/www.usdebtclock.org)) highlight ongoing fiscal challenges.\n- Discussions around the long-term solvency of programs like Social Security and Medicare are ongoing.\n- Future tax rates are subject to change; current rates may not persist indefinitely.\n\n**SECTION 4 (20 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 21-32: Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees** (Changed from \"The 4 Tax Mistakes Costing Thousands\")\n\n**Slide 21: Section Title**\n\n- **Four Key Tax Planning Considerations for Retirees**\n- **(Opportunities for Potential Savings)**\n\n**Slide 22: Understanding Different Account Types**\n\n- One approach for **Proactive Planners**\n- One approach for **Reactive Responders**\n- Goal: Strategically manage assets across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #1: MANAGING TAXABLE INTEREST**\n\n**Slide 23: Illustrative Scenario - Managing Taxable Interest** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual holds a significant amount in accounts generating taxable interest.\n- Thought high-interest accounts were always the most efficient.\n- Understanding the net impact after taxes and inflation is crucial.\n\n**Slide 24: Illustrating Net Return on Interest-Bearing Accounts**\n\n- Hypothetical Earning: 4.5% interest\n- Minus federal taxes (e.g., 24% marginal rate): -1.08%\n- **Net after taxes (hypothetical): 3.42%**\n- Minus inflation (e.g., 2.3%): -2.3%\n- **Real return (hypothetical): 1.12%**\n- *This illustrates how taxes and inflation can erode purchasing power.*\n\n**Slide 25: Exploring Alternatives for Interest Income**\n\n1.  Tax-exempt municipal bonds (consider specific state tax implications).\n2.  Tax-deferred fixed annuities (consider liquidity and surrender charges).\n3.  Growth-oriented investments in non-retirement accounts.\n4.  Exploring cash value life insurance for tax-advantaged accumulation (consider fees and suitability).\n\n**CONSIDERATION #2: EFFICIENT CHARITABLE GIVING** (Changed from \"DIVIDEND INCOME\" - This was a clear mismatch, the content was about QCDs)\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario - Charitable Giving** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual, aged [REDACTED:DATE], donates $10,500 annually.\n- Currently withdraws from an IRA, pays taxes, then donates the net amount.\n- **The Challenge:** To net $10,500 for charity, they might need to withdraw a larger amount from their IRA, with the difference going to taxes.\n- **Result:** A portion of their intended charitable contribution is directed to taxes.\n\n**Slide 27: Smart Solution - Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)**\n\n- **Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**\n- Donate DIRECTLY from your IRA to an eligible charity, if age 70.5 or older.\n- ✅ Charity typically receives the full amount.\n- ✅ Can count towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD).\n- ✅ The distributed amount is excluded from your taxable income.\n- **Potential Benefit:** This strategy could allow for a more tax-efficient way to support charitable causes.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #3: OPTIMIZING ASSET LOCATION** (Changed from \"IRA DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CHARITY\" - The content was about asset location, not IRA distributions for charity)\n\n**Slide 28: Illustrative Scenario - Asset Location** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** An individual reports significant taxable dividends and interest income.\n- This leads to higher annual tax obligations.\n- **Observation:** This individual is still working and files as single.\n\n**Slide 29: Strategic Asset Location**\n\n- **Consider holding income-generating investments (e.g., dividend stocks, bonds) within tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs, 401ks).**\n- **Consider holding growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks with low dividends) in taxable accounts.**\n- **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) offer a \"triple tax advantage\":**\n    - Tax-deductible contributions (if eligible).\n    - Tax-deferred growth.\n    - Tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.\n\n**CONSIDERATION #4: MANAGING CAPITAL GAINS** (Changed from \"CAPITAL GAINS WITHOUT PLANNING\")\n\n**Slide 26: Illustrative Scenario - Capital Gains** (Changed from \"Meet [REDACTED:NAME] & [REDACTED:NAME]\")\n\n- **Hypothetical Situation:** A couple sold company stock, realizing a significant long-term capital gain.\n- Consequently, they incurred a substantial tax liability.\n- **Potential Opportunity:** They might have overlooked strategies like tax loss harvesting.\n\n**Slide 27: Proactive Capital Gains Management**\n\n- **Consider reviewing your realized gain-loss report annually, particularly towards year-end.**\n- **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Sell investments at a loss to potentially offset capital gains.\n- **Excess Losses:** Up to $3,000 of excess capital losses can typically be deducted against ordinary income per year, with remaining losses carried forward.\n- **Remember:** Be mindful of the wash sale rule, which prohibits repurchasing substantially identical securities within 30 days before or after the sale.\n\n**Slide 28: The Value of Proactive Tax Planning** (Changed from \"The Voluntary Taxation Trap\")\n\n- The IRS collects taxes based on current law and your specific financial situation.\n- Understanding available strategies and options can help you manage your tax obligations more effectively.\n- Knowledge and proactive planning are key to potentially optimizing your tax outcomes.\n\n**Slide 28.5: Common Observations from Our Clients** (Changed from \"The Biggest Regret We Hear...\")\n\n- “I wish I had started planning for this earlier.”\n- \"I'm surprised by how much more efficient my tax strategy could have been.\"\n- “I appreciate understanding these strategies now.”\n\n**CLOSING SECTION (5 minutes)**\n\n**Slides 29-36: Next Steps** (Changed from \"Call to Action\")\n\n**Slide 29: Exploring Your Opportunities**\n\n- Each illustrative scenario highlights potential planning opportunities.\n- Many tax considerations arise from a lack of coordinated planning.\n- The question: Will you explore your options and take action?\n\n**Slide 30: Your Next Step -

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services are engineered to secure a robust 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology designed to shield your plan from the drag of poor-performing investments. By rigorously filtering for quality, we aim to position your plan to capture growth potential while effectively managing downside exposure. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey.

Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives.

This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services are engineered to secure a robust 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology designed to shield your plan from the drag of poor-performing investments. By rigorously filtering for quality, we aim to position your plan to capture growth potential while effectively managing downside exposure. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey. We strive to help employees build confidence in their financial future while supporting your plan's adherence to fiduciary best practices.\n\n**Comprehensive Fee Benchmarking**\nOur Fee Benchmarking Service is designed to help assess whether your 401(k) plan’s fees are competitive, transparent, and aligned with industry standards. We conduct comprehensive cost analysis, comparing your plan’s expenses to similar plans to help identify potential efficiencies and improvements. Through our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we seek to help you optimize services and strive for expenses that provide value to your business and employees.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees. Our goal is to assist with these complexities, so you can concentrate on your core business with greater confidence.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Optimized 401(k) Investment Management**\nStrategic. Objective-Focused. Goal-Oriented.\n\nOur goal is for your 401(k) lineup to feature carefully selected investment options, utilizing advanced technology to support an objective analysis process. Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous selection and monitoring, aiming to provide participants with access to quality investment options.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Lineup Management:**\n\n**Objective Fund Selection**\nWe employ a data-driven approach to select funds based on factors like historical performance, risk characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria. Our methodology aims to identify and address options that may no longer align with the plan's objectives, supporting a robust and competitive investment lineup.\n\n**Cost & Suitability Analysis**\nWe evaluate expense ratios, management fees, and overall fund efficiency. Our objective is to seek to minimize costs where appropriate, while maintaining quality investment choices that align with your organization's objectives.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to help support compliance with ERISA and other fiduciary standards, assisting plan sponsors in meeting their legal obligations while seeking to support positive participant outcomes.\n\n**Participant-Focused Approach**\nWe aim to provide education and tools to empower employees in making informed retirement decisions, helping them work towards their long-term financial goals.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Technology-Driven Analysis**\nAdvanced analytics support our fund selection and monitoring process, aiming for informed investment decisions.\n\n**Transparency & Accountability**\nWe act in the best interests of your plan, striving to provide transparency in our fund selection process and ongoing updates.\n\n**Experienced Guidance & Support**\nOur experienced team is dedicated to supporting you and your employees with customized insights and ongoing education.\n\nWith our investment management approach, your 401(k) investment lineup is designed to be strategic and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Holistic Financial Planning for Participants**\n\n**Helping Participants Maximize the Potential Value of Their 401(k)**\nMany employees may underestimate the potential value of their 401(k) plan. We believe a well-supported retirement plan can be a valuable tool in pursuing long-term financial security. Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape. We offer personalized support through:\n\n*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Tailored guidance to help align retirement goals with financial strategies. These meetings aim to allow employees to ask specific questions, set goals, and adjust their strategies as their financial needs evolve.\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Providing insights on saving, investing, and retirement readiness. Our workshops may cover topics such as Social Security considerations, market insights, tax-efficient investing principles, and strategies for retirement income planning.\n*   **Holistic Financial Planning Support:** Assistance in considering how 401(k) contributions fit into overall financial wellness. We aim to help employees understand how their retirement savings integrate into a larger financial strategy, which may include debt management, emergency savings, and future financial goals.\n\n**Fostering Financial Confidence**\nBy striving to empower employees with knowledge and tools, we aim to help build confidence in their financial future. A strong financial foundation may contribute to reduced financial stress and enhanced overall well-being. Our approach seeks to equip both employees and plan sponsors with resources to help make the most of their retirement planning journey.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals.

Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous cost analysis, aiming to help participants receive competitive value.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Fee Assessment:**\n\n**Comprehensive Cost Analysis**\nWe compare your plan’s expenses against appropriate peer group plans using market data. This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing. This process includes evaluating provider qualifications, assessing the scope and quality of services offered, and analyzing cost structures, with the goal of maximizing the value of plan expenses while maintaining quality service for your business and employees.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to align with current DOL guidance and industry considerations, aiming to help plan sponsors fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities regarding reasonable plan fees.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Independent & Objective Analysis**\nWe operate with independence, focusing on objective fee assessments and provider recommendations without proprietary conflicts of interest.\n\n**Deep Industry Experience**\nOur team brings extensive experience in retirement plan consulting, providing insights and strategic guidance tailored to your plan’s needs.\n\n**Proactive Cost Management Support**\nWe monitor market trends and provider pricing, helping you stay informed about fee structures and potentially identify cost-effective solutions.\n\nWith our fee benchmarking support, your 401(k) plan is intended to be cost-effective, supported for compliance, and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.
