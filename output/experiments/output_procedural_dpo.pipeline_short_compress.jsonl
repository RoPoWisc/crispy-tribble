Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our fee-only structure eliminates all conflicts of interest inherent in financial services, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially.

We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

Our approach utilizes advanced technology for objective investment analysis, aiming to minimize potential biases often associated with proprietary mutual funds. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan.

We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey. We strive to help employees build confidence in their financial future while supporting your plan's adherence to fiduciary best practices.\n\n**Comprehensive Fee Benchmarking**\nOur Fee Benchmarking Service is designed to help assess whether your 401(k) plan’s fees are competitive, transparent, and aligned with industry standards.

Through our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we seek to help you optimize services and strive for expenses that provide value to your business and employees.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees. Our goal is to assist with these complexities, so you can concentrate on your core business with greater confidence.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Optimized 401(k) Investment Management**\nStrategic. Objective-Focused. Goal-Oriented.\n\nOur goal is for your 401(k) lineup to feature carefully selected investment options, utilizing advanced technology to support an objective analysis process. Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous selection and monitoring, aiming to provide participants with access to quality investment options.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Lineup Management:**\n\n**Objective Fund Selection**\nWe employ a data-driven approach to select funds based on factors like historical performance, risk characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria. Our methodology aims to identify and address options that may no longer align with the plan's objectives, supporting a robust and competitive investment lineup.\n\n**Cost & Suitability Analysis**\nWe evaluate expense ratios, management fees, and overall fund efficiency. Our objective is to seek to minimize costs where appropriate, while maintaining quality investment choices that align with your organization's objectives.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to help support compliance with ERISA and other fiduciary standards, assisting plan sponsors in meeting their legal obligations while seeking to support positive participant outcomes.\n\n**Participant-Focused Approach**\nWe aim to provide education and tools to empower employees in making informed retirement decisions, helping them work towards their long-term financial goals.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Technology-Driven Analysis**\nAdvanced analytics support our fund selection and monitoring process, aiming for informed investment decisions.\n\n**Transparency & Accountability**\nWe act in the best interests of your plan, striving to provide transparency in our fund selection process and ongoing updates.\n\n**Experienced Guidance & Support**\nOur experienced team is dedicated to supporting you and your employees with customized insights and ongoing education.\n\nWith our investment management approach, your 401(k) investment lineup is designed to be strategic and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Holistic Financial Planning for Participants**\n\n**Helping Participants Maximize the Potential Value of Their 401(k)**\nMany employees may underestimate the potential value of their 401(k) plan. We believe a well-supported retirement plan can be a valuable tool in pursuing long-term financial security. Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape. We offer personalized support through:\n\n*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Tailored guidance to help align retirement goals with financial strategies. These meetings aim to allow employees to ask specific questions, set goals, and adjust their strategies as their financial needs evolve.\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Providing insights on saving, investing, and retirement readiness. Our workshops may cover topics such as Social Security considerations, market insights, tax-efficient investing principles, and strategies for retirement income planning.\n*   **Holistic Financial Planning Support:** Assistance in considering how 401(k) contributions fit into overall financial wellness. We aim to help employees understand how their retirement savings integrate into a larger financial strategy, which may include debt management, emergency savings, and future financial goals.\n\n**Fostering Financial Confidence**\nBy striving to empower employees with knowledge and tools, we aim to help build confidence in their financial future. A strong financial foundation may contribute to reduced financial stress and enhanced overall well-being. Our approach seeks to equip both employees and plan sponsors with resources to help make the most of their retirement planning journey.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals.

Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous cost analysis, aiming to help participants receive competitive value.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Fee Assessment:**\n\n**Comprehensive Cost Analysis**\nWe compare your plan’s expenses against appropriate peer group plans using market data. This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing. This process includes evaluating provider qualifications, assessing the scope and quality of services offered, and analyzing cost structures, with the goal of maximizing the value of plan expenses while maintaining quality service for your business and employees.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to align with current DOL guidance and industry considerations, aiming to help plan sponsors fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities regarding reasonable plan fees.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Independent & Objective Analysis**\nWe operate with independence, focusing on objective fee assessments and provider recommendations without proprietary conflicts of interest.\n\n**Deep Industry Experience**\nOur team brings extensive experience in retirement plan consulting, providing insights and strategic guidance tailored to your plan’s needs.\n\n**Proactive Cost Management Support**\nWe monitor market trends and provider pricing, helping you stay informed about fee structures and potentially identify cost-effective solutions.\n\nWith our fee benchmarking support, your 401(k) plan is intended to be cost-effective, supported for compliance, and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and verifying that your assets will outlast your life expectancy. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and verifying that your assets will outlast your life expectancy. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Despite heightened uncertainty resulting from a government shutdown, markets generally exhibited resilience. Historically, shutdowns have shown limited long-term market impact, though they have the potential to increase short-term volatility. Large-cap indices once again led the market, outperforming equal-weight and value-focused areas, while small-cap stocks began to show signs of outperformance.\n\nMarket leadership remained concentrated in mega-cap technology and communication services, supported by companies such as [REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:NAME], and [REDACTED:NAME], which continued to invest heavily in cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers. Gold experienced gains as investors sought safety amid slowing growth, geopolitical tensions, and potential further quantitative easing. Internationally, equities delivered positive returns, with [REDACTED:ORG], [REDACTED:ORG], and Emerging Markets advancing. Bonds also posted gains, supported by solid fundamentals across intermediate and high-yield segments.\n\n**Portfolios**\n\nThe [REDACTED:ORG] portfolios generated positive returns for the quarter. Underlying holdings within the portfolios generally achieved positive returns, reflecting broad strength across multiple market segments. Growth-focused assets led the market, but areas such as Value, Hedged Equity, and Small Caps also showed positive results. Active Fixed Income positions contributed to performance relative to the bond index, while diversifying assets such as Gold positively influenced overall returns.\n\n***Important Disclosure: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investing involves risk, including the potential for loss of principal.***\n\n**Market Outlook**\n\nThe third quarter of 2025 saw a reduction in market volatility compared to the first half of the year, as markets navigated tariff uncertainties and policy challenges. This market resilience coincided with new highs in Q3. Looking ahead, we believe that stocks may continue to climb modestly through the end of the year, potentially supported by corporate earnings, a rebound in GDP during the second quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s recent shift in lowering interest rates.\n\nAs we enter the final quarter of 2025, several key factors will likely influence market performance. The path and pace of Fed rate cuts will be closely watched, particularly given mixed economic signals and ongoing political discussions. The Federal Reserve has indicated the possibility of additional rate cuts in 2025.\n\nHowever, trade considerations, deficit spending, and global concerns are factors that may continue to influence the bond market over the next few months.\n\nThe sustainability of economic growth remains a central question, especially given observed differences between GDP growth and employment trends. Whether the economy can maintain momentum or will require additional policy support will be important to monitor. This environment reinforces the importance of maintaining discipline and focusing on long-term objectives rather than reacting to the constant stream of headlines. The remainder of 2025 will likely continue to present challenges for investor patience, but historical patterns suggest that a disciplined, long-term approach has often been beneficial for investors pursuing their financial goals, though it does not guarantee specific outcomes.\n\n***Disclaimer: Market forecasts and opinions are based on current market conditions and are subject to change without notice.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors focus on potential rates of return, a holistic planning relationship delivers tax-efficient strategies and tailored investment approaches structured to efficiently offset the drag of advisory fees. Ultimately, paying for quality guidance is often the surest path to securing value that outpaces the cost.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers.

Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time.

While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others.

And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors focus on potential rates of return, a holistic planning relationship delivers tax-efficient strategies and tailored investment approaches structured to efficiently offset the drag of advisory fees. Ultimately, paying for quality guidance is often the surest path to securing value that outpaces the cost.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy focuses on how to protect, grow, and transfer wealth with intention. Leveraging technology allows a plan’s potential sustainability to be evaluated against various scenarios for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

The strategy employs a disciplined selection process that considers factors such as market capitalization, sector and industry exposures, dividend yield, price/earnings ratio, price/book ratio, and earnings growth. The objective is to replicate the benchmark's returns while managing a portfolio with a focused number of securities. The portfolio's tracking error relative to the benchmark is regularly monitored and adjusted as needed to maintain acceptable levels.\n\n**Inception Date:** March 4, [REDACTED:DATE]\n**Benchmark:** 100% S&P 500 Index\n\n---\n\n**Performance Summary**\n\n| Period          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| 1 Month         | 4.88%            | 5.08%         |\n| Quarter-to-Date | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n| 1 Quarter       | 9.55%            | 10.93%        |\n\n**Annualized Performance**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the performance shown in the table above.)**\n*SERE Core Equity vs. S&P 500 Index for the periods ending 06/30/2025.*\n**(Visual representation of the above table data)**\n\n**Cumulative Return: Growth of $10,000**\n\n**(Chart data reflects the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment over the periods shown.)**\n*Investment Period: February 2025 - June 2025*\n**(Visual representation of cumulative growth for SERE Core Equity and S&P 500 Index)**\n\n---\n\n**Historical Risk & Return Analytics**\n\n**Horizon:** 02/28/[REDACTED:DATE] to 06/30/2025\n\n| Metric                        | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Annualized Return             | 4.69%            | 6.24%         |\n| Annualized Standard Deviation | 4.77%            | 3.61%         |\n| Beta                          | 1.00             | 0.75          |\n| Alpha                         | --               | 0.65          |\n| Sharpe Ratio                  | 0.67             | 1.32          |\n| Information Ratio             | --               | 0.96          |\n| Tracking Error                | --               | 1.35          |\n| Upside Capture %              | 100.00%          | 89.79%        |\n| Downside Capture %            | 100.00%          | 61.38%        |\n\n*Note: Alpha, Information Ratio, Tracking Error, Upside Capture %, and Downside Capture % are relative measures calculated against the S&P 500 Index.*\n\n---\n\n**Equity Snapshot**\n\n**Report As Of:** June 30, 2025\n**Currency:** USD\n\n**Asset Allocation**\n\n*   **Equity:** 100.00% \n*   **Invested Total:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Market Cap Exposure**\n\n*   **Large Cap >$10B:** 100.00%\n\n**Equity Sector Weights**\n\n**(Chart showing sector weights for Portfolio vs. Benchmark)**\n*Examples: Technology, Finance, Consumer Non-Cyclicals, Industrials, Healthcare, etc.*\n\n**Equity Breakdown**\n\n**(Chart showing Portfolio vs. Benchmark distribution by sector and cash)**\n\n**Equity Characteristics**\n\n| Characteristic          | SERE Core Equity | S&P 500 Index |\n| :---------------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| Market Capitalization   | $1,315,094.90 M  | $1,145,158.40 M |\n| Dividend Yield          | 1.28%            | 1.23%         |\n| Price/Book              | 22.82            | 17.81         |\n| Price/Earnings          | 25.60            | 27.20         |\n| Est 3-5 Yr EPS Growth   | 11.90%           | 11.90%        |\n| # of Securities         | 41               | 506           |\n\n**Top 10 Holdings**\n\n*(Based on Portfolio Weight as of June 30, 2025)*\n\n| Holding                           | Portfolio Weight (%) | Benchmark Weight (%) | Total Return QTD (%) |\n| :-------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |\n| Microsoft Corporation             | 8.82                 | 9.05                 | 32.75                |\n| NVIDIA Corporation                | 7.74                 | 7.94                 | 45.78                |\n| Apple Inc.                        | 6.47                 | 6.64                 | -7.52                |\n| Amazon.com, Inc.                  | 4.83                 | 4.96                 | 15.31                |\n| Meta Platforms Inc Class A        | 4.39                 | 4.51                 | 28.16                |\n| Alphabet Inc.
