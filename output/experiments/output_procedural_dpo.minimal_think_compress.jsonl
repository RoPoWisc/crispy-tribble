That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you. It is important to remember that we have designed your portfolio based on your individual circumstances, personal risk tolerance, and specific financial goals. Diversification aims to mitigate market volatility; while one part of a portfolio may experience declines at a given time, other parts may retain or gain value. Your portfolio is diversified across various parameters, which may include allocations to stocks versus bonds, U.S. versus international markets, developed versus emerging markets, and public versus private (alternative) investments.\n\n*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.*\n\n---\n\n**We Are Here For You**\n\nLike you, we prefer when markets are performing positively. However, we want you to know that we are equally dedicated to supporting you during periods of market downturns. If you would like to schedule some time to discuss any of this in more detail, you can reach me via [REDACTED:EMAIL] or use the link below to schedule an appointment.\n\n---\n\n**General Disclosure:**\n\n*Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nBy strictly adhering to this investment philosophy, we are able to identify companies with superior long-term growth potential that outperform the broader market. Our proprietary research allows us to filter out volatility and focus solely on long-term compounding. This strategic focus ensures that client portfolios are positioned to capture maximum upside while avoiding significant downturns, providing a secure path to wealth accumulation.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption.

This strategic focus ensures that client portfolios are positioned to capture maximum upside while avoiding significant downturns, providing a secure path to wealth accumulation.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.

This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds.

Savings could be depleted.\n\nThe family could be stressing, wondering what’s next.\nThe business, too, would be significantly at risk.\n\nThis is often the moment of realization.\n\nSavings are a cushion.\nThey buy you time.\n\nIncome protection, however, is a plan.\nIt aims to keep the lights on.\nIt can help cover payroll.\nIt can help put food on the table.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction can lead to a proactive decision.\n\nBecause once you see the potential countdown clock on your savings, it's hard to unsee it.\n\nSo let me ask you:\nIf your savings might only buy you three months, what’s your plan for your family and your business in month four?\n\n---\n\n**LinkedIn 2 (Compliant Version)**\n\n“Don’t worry kids, Dad is going to invest the difference.”\n\nThat might sound like a joke…\nuntil you realize it’s a perspective some people genuinely rely on.\n\nA frequent sentiment we encounter is:\n“Life insurance is a waste. I’ll just invest the difference.”\n\nTake, for example, a hypothetical law firm owner who once shared a similar thought:\n“I believe I’m adequately covered; I have $1.5 million of life insurance already.”\n\nThat figure sounds substantial, doesn't it?\n\nHowever, when we apply a comprehensive financial planning process, such as using our Asset-Map tool, to visualize all financial elements — income, assets, goals, obligations — a different picture can emerge.\n\nConsider these potential details for such a professional:\n– $500,000 annual income to replace\n– Two children (with a third on the way)\n– A non-working spouse\n– A growing law firm with payroll and overhead\n\nIn this context, that $1.5 million might suddenly appear insufficient. It could cover approximately three years of income replacement.\n\nThis prompts a crucial question for consideration:\n“If that coverage is depleted in three years, what is the plan for financial continuity beyond that point?”\n\nThe silence that often follows this question highlights a critical truth:\nInvesting is a smart financial strategy. But it is not always a direct replacement for foundational protection.\n\nA family may find it challenging to pay the mortgage with an investment \"plan\" alone in times of crisis.\nEmployees cannot rely on spreadsheets to cover their living expenses.\n\nThe potential gap can be significant. Once understood, it's difficult to ignore.\n\nThe positive outcome of identifying such a gap is the opportunity to address it.\nImplementing appropriate coverage can provide clarity and reduce financial uncertainty.\nThis can offer confidence that a family is safeguarded and a business has a more secure future, regardless of unforeseen events.\n\nThat’s what comprehensive financial planning aims to achieve.\nIt seeks to transform \"I think I’m good\" into \"I know we’re covered.\"\n\nStop making assumptions. Let’s explore your financial landscape through a detailed process like Asset-Map to understand your current standing – before potential challenges arise.\n\n---\n\n**LinkedIn 3 (Compliant Version)**\n\nMany professionals, particularly law firm owners, may initially feel \"I’m good\"… until a thorough financial review reveals a different story.\n\nConsider a recent hypothetical discussion with a professional earning, for example, $500,000 a year, managing a growing firm, and already possessing $1.5 million in life insurance.\n\nWhen a discovery meeting is suggested, a common initial reaction might be the classic, “I’m good.”\n\nUpon asking for clarification on what \"good\" entails, it often comes down to a feeling of being in a strong position, combined with a lack of time for a detailed review.\n\nSometimes, a brief, focused conversation can be proposed to quickly assess if that feeling holds true.\nIf it does, both parties can move forward confidently.\nIf not, it presents an opportunity to consider available choices.\n\nDuring such a hypothetical meeting, utilizing a process like our Asset-Map can provide a single-page overview of all critical financial facts — income, assets, obligations, and goals.\n\nAnd here’s what such an assessment might reveal:\n$1.5 million can seem substantial… until it’s measured against real-life responsibilities.\nFor instance:\n– Two children, with a third on the way\n– A non-working spouse\n– A business with payroll and overhead\n\nIn this context, $1.5 million could potentially cover only about three years of income replacement.\n\nThis can lead to a stark question:\n“If existing coverage is exhausted in three years, what contingency is in place for the family and business beyond that point?”\n\nThis type of realization can be impactful.\n\nThe family home, the business, the staff, and the future desired for dependents — all could be at risk sooner than anticipated without proper planning.\n\nThis moment often brings clarity, as the financial realities are laid bare.\nHowever, it can also bring relief — because once a potential gap is identified, it can be addressed.\n\nBy developing and implementing an appropriate strategy, professionals can often gain greater peace of mind.\nThey may feel more confident that their family is protected.\nThey can gain relief knowing their firm has a more secure foundation.\nAnd ultimately, they may experience greater peace of mind knowing their financial plan is comprehensive.\n\nThat’s what diligent financial planning aims to achieve.\nIt seeks to transform \"I’m good\" into \"I know we’re covered.\"\n\nIf you’ve been thinking “I’m good,” let’s consider a review using a tool like Asset-Map. The most positive outcome? You confirm your strong position. The even better outcome? You identify and address potential blind spots before they become significant challenges.", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere is the revised marketing copy, updated for compliance with SEC RIA marketing rules.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts. As hypothetical performance results do not represent actual trading, they may not reflect the impact of material economic and market factors that might have affected FFG's decision-making if it were managing actual client money. There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses.

There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. This serves as an illustration of a structured note performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. This serves as an illustration of a structured note performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

Each type has different volatility and growth characteristics, and most portfolios typically include a component of each. Determining the appropriate allocation between these two types is a foundational step in any investment decision process.\n\n1.  **GROWTH INVESTMENTS**\n\n    **Growth** investments generally include equities (stocks), variable annuities, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest primarily in stocks. With growth-oriented investments, including real estate, the seller of the investment makes no guarantee of principal, and there is typically no maturity date. Investors generally seek to sell the asset later for a higher price than they paid. Historically, growth investments have offered potential for greater appreciation in value compared to fixed income over time, but they are also subject to more significant short-term price volatility. These investments are often more attractive when an investor has a significant time horizon to potentially navigate and recover from market fluctuations.\n\n    Market fluctuations from year to year can be substantial. For example, during the financial crisis of 2008, stocks experienced significant declines; in 2021, the S&P 500, a stock market index measuring the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, saw a gain of approximately 27%. In 2022, stocks experienced a downturn, with the S&P 500 down roughly 19% and technology stocks down about 31%. In 2023, markets rebounded, with the S&P 500 averaging a gain of 24%, and technology stocks up approximately 37%. It's common for the stock market to temporarily decline about 30% from its prior peak during a typical recession.\n\n    **Historically, stocks over the last 70 years have generated an average annual return of approximately 10-12%.** **Based on this historical average, the value of an investment would theoretically double about every eight years. Please note that historical averages are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee future returns. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.**\n\n    A common challenge for growth/stock investors is managing emotions during cyclical market movements. When stocks are rising, some investors may be tempted to invest in lower-quality or speculative assets. Conversely, when stocks are declining, investors may become fearful and consider selling or becoming overly conservative, even though such reactions are often detrimental to long-term returns. A key part of our firm’s role is to help clients maintain a disciplined approach and focus on quality investments, aiming to mitigate emotionally driven decisions.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** for an illustration of how $1 invested in large company stock in 1926 grew to approximately $7,353 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This illustration demonstrates that despite historic periods of wars, recessions, and economic crises, stocks have historically shown a long-term tendency toward growth.\n\n2.  **FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS**\n\n    In contrast to growth investments, **fixed income** type investments generally include cash, bank money market accounts, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), fixed annuities, government bonds, corporate bonds, and mutual funds or ETFs that invest in these instruments. Fixed income values typically fluctuate less than stocks but generally do not provide the same opportunity for capital appreciation beyond their income generation. However, unlike with stocks, the issuer usually contractually promises to return the principal at a designated maturity date. Historically, over the last 50 years, corporate bonds, for instance, have produced an average overall annual growth of about 4-6%. This growth primarily originates from the cash interest income they produce. **Past performance is not indicative of future results.**\n\n    Municipal bonds, another fixed income instrument, typically offer somewhat lower yields because their income is often exempt from federal income tax. Bank CDs also tend to offer lower yields, reflecting their federal insurance, and current rates have historically ranged from approximately 0.6% to 4.5% (as of the date of this plan). U.S. Treasury bonds maturing in 10 years are currently yielding about 4.44% annually (as of the date of this plan). Unlike corporate bonds, which are backed by the issuing company, bank CDs are federally insured (within limits), and U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\n    Please refer to the attached **\"Historical Market Performance, 1926-2017\" chart** which illustrates how $1 invested in government bonds in 1926, with an average annual return of 5.5%, grew to approximately $143 by 2017. **This chart reflects the historical performance of market indices and is provided for illustrative purposes only. It does not represent the performance of any actual investment, strategy, or account. It does not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing involves risk.** This historical illustration shows significantly less growth than that of stocks, but also historically exhibits less year-to-year volatility.\n\n    **The first step in any investment decision is to determine the appropriate allocation of assets between growth and fixed income.**\n\n---\n\n**Specific Recommendations for [REDACTED:NAME]**\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n\nBased on our conversations and your risk tolerance survey, our initial recommendation is a dynamic portfolio designed to seek a balanced potential for growth through equity investments, complemented by fixed income investments for stability. The attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** hypothetically reflects an initial allocation of 60% stocks and 40% fixed income, representing a slightly less aggressive approach compared to your current allocation of approximately 63% stock and 37% fixed. **This Proposed Investment Plan chart is a hypothetical illustration of an initial asset allocation strategy and does not represent actual performance or guarantee future results. Investing involves risk, and the actual performance of these allocations will vary.**\n\nWe recommend considering the sale of the Annuity contract in your individual account. Given the estimated surrender fee of approximately 4.7%, we believe that for your specific situation, the benefits of simplifying your investments and financial life by reinvesting these funds outweigh the cost of the surrender fee.\n\n**Stock Investment Philosophy:**\n\nFor the equities we initially recommend, our firm endeavors to align with an investment philosophy that seeks strong, well-managed companies. Our process involves extensive and continuous research to identify leading companies that meet our criteria. We focus on businesses with ethical management, strong competitive positions, and positive financial trends, particularly those we believe are well-positioned to thrive over the long term, rather than being vulnerable to technological disruption. Should an investment no longer meet our criteria, it will be considered for removal from our core recommendations.\n\nWhile our investment philosophy is centered on identifying companies with long-term growth potential, future appreciation is not guaranteed, and markets can be unpredictable in the short term. We aim for long-term compounding, understanding that short-term fluctuations are a natural part of market cycles.\n\nIt is common for stock markets to experience periods of advancement followed by corrections. For example, during 2022, the overall market experienced a significant decline. While no one can predict short-term market movements, our focus remains on long-term investment principles.\n\n**Timing the Market:** Our firm does not attempt to predict market movements or time buys and sells based on short-term forecasts. Markets are dynamic and often unpredictable. Generally, for existing holdings, our strategy is to maintain long-term positions. However, we continuously monitor our core recommended investments for opportunities where current valuations may appear attractive relative to their perceived long-term growth potential.\n\nThe specific initial recommendations outlined in the attached **\"Proposed Investment Plan\" chart** are generally categorized into three groups: Dynamic Growth, Growth and Income, and Income-focused Equities.\n\nThe first group, **Dynamic Growth**, features Vanguard’s Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to a diversified group of technology companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others. Additionally, we initially recommend specific growth-focused companies including Amazon, Palo Alto Networks (a network security company), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), GE Aerospace (aircraft engines), Booking Holdings, and Alphabet Inc. (Google).\n\nThe second group, **Growth and Income**, includes companies that we believe offer potential for growth while also providing a degree of stability. We recommend Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which is a low-expense ETF that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest and most dominant companies in the U.S. market. We also initially recommend specific companies such as Progressive Insurance, Waste Management, and Royal Caribbean Group.\n\nThe third group, **Income-focused Equities**, typically focuses on companies that aim to pay competitive dividend rates, while also offering potential for capital appreciation. For your portfolio, we recommend the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU), a diversified fund composed of major utility providers in the market.\n\nOur initial plan aims to diversify across various sectors, including technology, travel, utilities, and insurance, to manage risk and pursue growth opportunities.\n\nFor **fixed income**, we recommend a collection of individual corporate bonds. These bonds typically have set maturity dates and can be sold on the bond market if liquidity is needed. Current yields on corporate bonds can be around 5.5% (as of the date of this plan). We also recommend the VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF), which provides exposure to a basket of preferred stocks, excluding those from the financial sector.\n\nThe \"Yield %\" column in the attached chart indicates the estimated annual yield payout each particular investment currently provides. This annual income does not represent the total return of the investments, which would also include any appreciation or depreciation in the asset's value. Asset values can fluctuate and are not guaranteed to appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**Mechanics of Account Set-up and Funding**\n\nThere are four steps to complete the transfer to our firm’s advisory services:\n\n1.  We assist in opening your account(s) at Schwab and facilitating the transfer of your existing securities.\n2.  You review and approve the initial financial plan developed by Dougherty Investment Advisors. This is a collaborative process, and we welcome your input and suggested modifications.\n3.  Upon your approval, we execute initial trades as agreed upon in the financial plan.\n4.  We continuously monitor portfolio performance, make adjustments and recommendations as needed, and provide ongoing advice on financial issues as they arise.\n\nYou will receive monthly statements from Schwab, and you will have 24-hour online access to view your accounts. Our firm will continue to monitor the accounts and proactively recommend any necessary changes.\n\n---\n\n**Dougherty Investment Management Practice**\n\nOur investment practice currently manages approximately $115 million in assets for over 200 clients (as of the date of this plan). We manage each of our clients’ accounts directly, without third-party delegation or additional fees from outside managers. We utilize Schwab as the independent custodian to hold the investments within your accounts.\n\nFor assets under management, Dougherty Investment Advisors operates as a **fee-only advisor**. This means our compensation comes solely from the advisory fees paid directly by our clients, and we do not receive commissions, sales loads, or referral fees from other institutions, mutual funds, or any trading activity in your accounts. As fiduciaries, our compensation structure is designed to align our interests entirely with yours, ensuring that our recommendations are solely based on what we believe is best for your financial goals.\n\nTo provide you with potentially lower advisory fees, we will aggregate your mother’s investment base with yours for family discount pricing. This allows you to reach lower investment fee thresholds sooner. Our annual advisory fee structure is as follows: 1.25% per year for assets under $250,000, 0.75% per year for assets managed in excess of $250,000 up to $1,000,000, and 0.65% per year for any assets exceeding $1,000,000. This fee is calculated based on the total family assets managed by us, billed quarterly from the client's account(s).\n\nDepending on the specific client’s needs, the accounts we manage at Schwab may include holdings such as stocks, ETFs, bonds, CDs, money market funds, and mutual funds. Schwab serves solely as the custodian for the accounts we manage on your behalf.\n\nIn our role as financial advisors, we are available to address and assist with any financial planning questions you may have throughout your life stages. We consider ourselves an extension of your financial team, ready to advise on matters such as tax considerations, major purchases like real estate and autos, and retirement planning.\n\nOur office operates as a collaborative team; no clients are assigned to a single individual. Seann, Nicholette, Patrick, and I all participate in the planning and administrative processes to ensure comprehensive support. Please feel free to call any time (office: [REDACTED:PHONE]; John’s cell [REDACTED:PHONE]; Seann’s cell 818-422-0999).\n\nIf you choose for us to manage your assets, we are required by law to provide you with a client agreement. There is no long-term commitment to use our services; you may discontinue our management permission at any time by contacting us or Schwab directly. Furthermore, with the exception of CDs that may be purchased for clients within the Schwab account (which may have early withdrawal penalties), the investments we recommend for your managed accounts typically do not have early withdrawal penalties, meaning they can generally be liquidated and transferred to other assets or institutions, or utilized, as needed.\n\nWe look forward to the opportunity to work with you and are committed to exceeding your expectations. We understand the importance of helping you manage your hard-earned nest egg.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn A.

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder that market timing can be difficult; investors who maintained their positions through the downturn may have experienced the subsequent market rebound, while those who sold might have foregone potential participation in the recovery.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nThis blog is published by [REDACTED:ORG].

This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup.

Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2.

Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

While holding cash can offer a sense of security, it's important to understand how significant cash positions might influence your long-term financial objectives. This consideration is particularly relevant given current market dynamics, with substantial amounts held in money market funds, totaling approximately $7.3 trillion according to recent reports.\n\nEffective long-term investing typically involves building a diversified portfolio that aligns with individual financial plans, rather than attempting to time market movements or choose between extremes. Cash certainly serves vital roles within these plans, especially for covering immediate expenses and establishing an emergency fund.\n\nHowever, when investors hold more cash than needed for these practical purposes—often referred to as \"excess cash\"—they may forgo opportunities for potential income, wealth accumulation, and the pursuit of other important financial objectives. Considering current market conditions, understanding how to strategically manage cash within a portfolio while working toward long-term goals is a key consideration.\n\nOver Time, Stocks and Bonds Have Historically Outpaced Inflation\n\nReviewing financial market history reveals that stocks and bonds have historically served as instruments for potential wealth building and maintaining purchasing power against inflation. Historical data (as may be depicted in an accompanying chart) indicates that, over extended periods, the value of stocks and bonds has appreciated significantly more than inflation. For instance, an item costing $1 in 1926 now costs approximately $18, while equity and fixed income markets have seen considerably greater growth over the same long-term horizon, contributing to potential wealth for investors who remained invested through various market cycles, including downturns, crises, and recessions over the past century.\n\n*Please note: Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.*\n\nWhile historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, recent market performance can serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of market sentiment and its potential impact on returns. Historically, even during periods of elevated inflation, a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds has, over certain long periods, demonstrated returns that outpaced inflation. Over extended durations, even modest returns above inflation can contribute to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding.\n\nWhen developing financial plans, cash plays important functional roles. It provides ready liquidity for near-term expenses and unforeseen events. For example, funds allocated for a soon-to-be-purchased home down payment or upcoming tuition fees due within a year are appropriately held in cash or cash-equivalent investments. Similarly, establishing an emergency fund offers crucial protection against unexpected life events such as job loss or medical emergencies.\n\nSignificant Cash Holdings May Gradually Reduce Purchasing Power\n\nPotential drawbacks can emerge when investors maintain cash reserves beyond these practical needs. This has been a common occurrence recently, influenced by market uncertainties and relatively higher interest rates on cash accounts. While cash may appear to offer stable principal value and attractive interest payments compared to bond yields or stock dividends, this approach can entail certain considerations.\n\nOne such consideration is inflation—the persistent rise in the prices of goods and services over time. Even when savings accounts or money market funds offer what appear to be favorable interest rates, these rates have historically often struggled to keep pace with annual increases in prices. For example, historical data (such as that depicted in an accompanying chart) illustrates that the real (inflation-adjusted) return from typical cash instruments, like certificates of deposit, has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\nA second consideration relates to the nature of short-term interest rates. While money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit, and savings accounts may currently offer appealing rates—especially when compared to the near-zero rates observed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis—these rates are not permanent. By their design, they are short-term and subject to change. While initial rates can be attractive, they are variable and require ongoing monitoring as they mature or reset.\n\nGenerally, cash and short-term bond investments require reinvestment at the prevailing rates when they mature. This introduces what is known as \"reinvestment risk.\" For instance, if monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve lead to declining rates, as has been discussed in financial commentary, short-term interest rates could decrease, potentially resulting in yields that fall below the rate of inflation. Investors might then face a choice: accept lower yields upon maturity or consider reallocating to longer-term investments. Historically, longer-term investments have often seen price increases when interest rates decline. Consequently, investors not positioned in such assets during these periods may forgo potential gains.\n\nThe dynamics differ with longer-term bonds, where yields may be locked in for several years or even decades. An investor purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond today secures that yield for the bond's duration, although the bond’s current market value may fluctuate. Similarly, while stock market outcomes are inherently uncertain, a long investment horizon has historically been associated with potential long-term growth, potentially reducing the constant need to reinvest at potentially lower rates.\n\nCash often feels secure because its account balance appears stable, even amidst market turbulence. However, for financial security, the focus should extend to what our money can actually purchase, beyond just the dollar amount in our accounts. If inflation is 3% annually while cash earns 2%, the buying power of those savings decreases by 1% per year, even if the account balance remains numerically constant. This seemingly small differential can accumulate significantly over time and impact long-term financial plans, particularly for individuals in retirement.\n\nSubstantial Amounts of Money Are Currently Held in Cash\n\nCash holdings offer insights not just into individual financial planning but also into broader market sentiment. Available data indicates that money market fund assets have reached substantial levels, currently at approximately $7.3 trillion, reflecting significant growth since pre-pandemic levels. This trend may reflect investors' pursuit of higher short-term interest rates and a preference for liquidity over longer-term investment commitments.\n\nHowever, as interest rates have begun to decline and with potential for future rate adjustments, these significant cash holdings may encounter reinvestment challenges. Investors who allocated substantial funds to cash during periods of temporarily high rates or market stress may now face reevaluation decisions. This situation is sometimes termed \"cash on the sidelines,\" referring to the possibility that some investors may consider reallocating these funds into other investment categories over time.\n\nStrategic approaches to managing cash beyond immediate needs vary based on personal goals but may include methods such as dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals over time. Current market conditions, including recent stock market performance and prevailing bond yields, may prompt investors to review their cash allocations. Yields on various fixed income securities, including longer-term Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds, may appear attractive when compared to certain historical periods. While predicting interest rates is challenging, bond market volatility has recently moderated. Recent stock market performance has also been noteworthy.\n\n**The bottom line? While cash serves essential functions, holding more than needed can present certain considerations. For long-term investors, maintaining an appropriate cash reserve while strategically investing in diversified, long-term portfolios can be an effective strategy for pursuing financial objectives.**\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*   All investments involve risk, including the potential loss of principal.\n*   Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n*   The information provided is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.\n*   This content is not an offer to buy or sell any security.\n*   Specific financial situations and investment goals should be discussed with a qualified financial advisor.\n*   Hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual performance.\n*   References to historical market data or trends do not guarantee future performance.\n*   Yields and market conditions are subject to change.", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere is the revised marketing copy, incorporating SEC RIA compliance standards while preserving the original intent and factual content:\n\n---\n\n**Blog post image (for main blog page) above post title:**\n\nPost Title: Could Significant Cash Holdings Impact Your Investment Portfolio?\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME] | Founder, Private Wealth Advisor**\n\nLong-term investors today may be evaluating their cash allocations, particularly as interest rates adjust.

The firm is defined as all accounts managed by [REDACTED:ORG]’s Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale Divisions. [REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. The firm manages a variety of equity portfolios, and also manages fixed income portfolios.\n\nAs of 9/30/2017, [REDACTED:ORG] was redefined to include all Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale accounts managed by the firm. Prior to this date and for the purposes of complying with the GIPS Standards, the firm’s Institutional division was defined separately from the firm’s Retail and Wholesale Division. Performance for the Focus Growth composite prior to 9/30/2017 consists of performance achieved at [REDACTED:ORG]’s Retail and Wholesale Division.\n\nThe Zacks Focus Growth Strategy (Inception Date: February 2003) invests in a diversified group of stocks that [REDACTED:ORG] believes will outperform the market over the next twelve months. The strategy primarily invests in growth-oriented stocks with a large-cap bias. The Focus Growth Strategy makes use of a proprietary multi-factor model. The Strategy typically contains 40 to 100 stocks and is diversified across multiple sectors. The strategy makes use of an optimizer. The strategy benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The minimum account size for inclusion in the composite is $100,000. The Focus Growth Composite was created in February 2003. A complete list of composite descriptions is available upon request.\n\n**Benchmark**\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index is a well-known, unmanaged index of the prices of 1000 large-company growth common stocks selected by Russell. **The Russell 1000 Growth Index assumes reinvestment of dividends but does not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.** The volatility of the benchmark may be materially different from the individual performance obtained by a specific investor. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.\n\n**Performance Calculations**\nValuations and returns are computed and stated in U.S. Dollars. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.\n*   **\\*Pure Gross of Fees Returns:** These returns are presented as supplemental information, are gross of transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding taxes.\n*   **\\*\\*Net of Fees Returns:** These returns are calculated using the highest management fee paid and are presented net of a bundled fee which includes transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding fees. The standard management fee for the Focus Growth strategy is 1.75% per annum. Additional information regarding fees is included in Part 2A of Form ADV.\n\nIf a cash flow amount exceeds 20% of the portfolio, that account’s performance will not be included for that month. Accounts are added back into the composite the following month. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of all accounts included in the composite for the entire year. Gross-of-fee returns are used for the calculation. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark gross returns over the preceding 36-month period.

When compared to the portfolio’s beta, a positive alpha indicates better-than-expected portfolio performance and a negative alpha worse-than-expected portfolio performance.\n*   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility of a portfolio relative to the overall market. A beta less than 1.0 indicates lower risk than the market; a beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher risk than the market. It is most reliable as a risk measure when the return fluctuations of the portfolio are highly correlated with the return fluctuations of the index chosen to represent the market.\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better risk-adjusted performance has been. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury bond) from the portfolio’s return and dividing this value by the portfolio’s standard deviation.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** An indicator of the portfolio’s total return volatility, which is based on a minimum of 36 monthly returns. The larger the portfolio’s standard deviation, the greater the portfolio’s volatility.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** The value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its issued and outstanding common stock. It is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price of a share.\n*   **Price/Book ratio (P/B):** The ratio of a stock’s price to its book value per share.\n*   **Price/Earnings ratio (P/E):** The price of a stock divided by its earnings per share.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** Not FDIC Insured | May Lose Value | Not Bank Guaranteed", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere's a revised version of your marketing copy, updated for SEC RIA compliance while preserving your original intent and voice:\n\n---\n\n**Current Market Volatility, Tariffs, and Your Investments**\n\nDear [REDACTED:NAME]:\n\nAn airline pilot once described flying as “long stretches of boredom, interspersed with brief moments of sheer panic.” While we are certainly not suggesting that recent financial market activity warrants panic, you may be wondering how current events could relate to your investments.\n\nPresident [REDACTED:NAME] made the imposition of tariffs on various US trading partners one of the central themes of his campaign. That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you.

That aspect was known. However, uncertainty about the exact shape, size, and extent of the tariffs had contributed to a state of unease in financial markets since early February. On April 2, President [REDACTED:NAME] announced a list of countries on which tariffs would be imposed, with some of the largest levies falling on China—a significant trade partner during the first [REDACTED:NAME] administration—and the European Union.\n\nThe equities markets reacted following the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling almost 5% in one day. When China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% the next day, markets experienced further declines; the S&P 500 fell by about 6%, resulting in a drop of more than 10% in value over two consecutive trading days. This trend and elevated volatility have continued into this week.\n\nIn light of these events, how might investors approach such situations? Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results.

I'll claim that Rule 1.4 specifically prohibits the use of the word \"ensure\" unless the advisor has a third-party insurance wrapper on the account.

Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III. Our Philosophy**\n\nEffective capital management involves designing solutions tailored to client objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our asset management approach combines independent analysis, specialized knowledge, and a connected platform.\n\nOur solutions are developed based on an understanding of our clients' objectives and priorities. Our approach aims to translate individual needs into well-structured, adaptable solutions.\n\nWe focus on designing solutions rather than merely offering products. We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V. Our Team**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] aims to provide capital management services in the region, grounded in an institutional approach, established standards, and a focus on structured wealth management.\n\nThe executive team combines local and international experience, strategic planning, and operational capability. Each member contributes to the firm's structure and aims to support value creation for clients.\n\nBelow, we introduce the professionals who lead our team: individuals with relevant experience and complementary focus.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**CEO & Principal, Investment Solutions**\nWith strategic vision and a focus on institutional growth, he leads [REDACTED:ORG]’s expansion through platform development, structural alliances, and multi-asset investment solutions. His leadership guides the evolution of the operational model, combining executive direction with a perspective on positioning and the firm's approach to value in capital management.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**COFO & Principal, Wealth Advisory**\nLeads the financial and operational structure of [REDACTED:ORG], integrating wealth advisory services with institutional standards and strategic orientation. Her leadership combines financial oversight, operational management, and a focus on wealth, supporting client relationships and the implementation of customized solutions.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Vice President, Investor Relations & Capital Solutions**\nStrengthens the relationship between the firm and its ecosystem of partners, articulating capital solutions and reinforcing institutional connections. Her management facilitates access to relevant opportunities and contributes to the firm's positioning.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Senior Wealth Advisor, Vice President**\nDevelops tailored wealth solutions for private clients, combining strategic vision, financial planning, and investment structures. Her guidance integrates technical depth with client relationships for the long term.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Client Portfolio Manager & Advisory**\nManages strategies within our partners’ portfolios, ensuring consistency with their objectives and the institutional guidelines of the firm. His role combines strategic monitoring, financial insight, and technical support, contributing to an active and structured wealth management process.\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME]**\n**Back Office / Infrastructure**\nManages key back-office processes, ensuring order, traceability, and operational support for the institutional platform. Her role is essential to maintain continuity, precision, and consistency in daily execution.\n\n**Asset Manager**\n\nOur place is alongside those who trust in management with purpose.\n\n**I. The Role of the Asset Manager**\n\nAn Asset Manager can play a key role in guiding capital decisions, offering independence, technical discipline, and execution capabilities to structure investment strategies.\n\nAn Asset Manager aims to translate market information into strategic insights and to organize, design, and connect elements to support investment frameworks. This includes managing risks and pursuing opportunities through defined methods.\n\nThe role extends beyond strategy selection to include interpreting market dynamics and structuring platforms. It aims to bring order to dispersed information and create structure around potential opportunities.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]: Our Approach to Asset Management**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with an institutional commitment. We have developed a platform structured to support our clients with established processes and structures aligned with their investment objectives.\n\nThis platform integrates strategies with investment vehicles, expertise with execution, and planning with discipline. Each solution is structured for a specific purpose and is designed to be adaptable across relevant jurisdictions and regulatory contexts.\n\nThe platform aims to provide clients access to global and regional strategies without requiring them to replicate the internal infrastructure typically needed for professional management. Execution involves segregated assets, supervised structures, and specialized counterparties, aiming for a precise, efficient, and transparent operating framework.\n\n**An Asset Manager: Organization, Protection, and Support**\n\nAn Asset Manager can serve as a strategic partner who helps organize market information, seeks to protect client interests, and helps shape a coherent financial strategy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we approach this role with dedication and focus. We design structures, facilitate access to investments, and aim to provide strategic direction.\n\n**II. Compliance and Regulation**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] operates under a regulatory framework that aligns with established standards and institutional governance principles.\n\nOur compliance framework enables us to manage strategies under licenses in relevant jurisdictions, contributing to operational integrity, traceability, and client access.\n\nThe firm operates under two key regulatory frameworks:\n\n*   **Registered Investment Adviser (RIA)**, regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States of America.\n*   **Approved Investment Manager (AIM)**, regulated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of the British Virgin Islands.\n\n**III. Risk and Corporate Governance**\n\nRisk management at [REDACTED:ORG] is an integrated discipline, incorporating specialized committees and operational frameworks.\n\nCorporate governance operates under principles of ongoing supervision, technical analysis, and control, aiming to support operational quality and informed decision-making.\n\nOur model incorporates international standards for risk mitigation, operational resilience, and internal control. Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV. Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nWe believe capital management should incorporate an ethical, responsible, and long-term perspective. We integrate sustainable principles into our investment model, considering initiatives that may generate positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we support programs that promote community development, education, and environmental preservation, based on the belief that value extends beyond financial returns.\n\nCorporate responsibility is integrated into our approach to investment and progress.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**I. Management Model**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] structures mandates using an independent management model that combines governance, defined operational processes, and proprietary infrastructure.\n\nEach solution is designed to address specific client objectives, structured through defined platforms, clear protocols, and established standards.\n\nWe view investment as strategic design. Portfolio traceability, financial clarity, and legal separation are key structural elements within our platform.\n\n**II. Metrics Reflecting Our Approach**\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our approach is supported by specialized platforms, global presence, and an integrated market presence.\n\nWe operate with defined processes and a structured approach that supports our framework. The following figures reflect our current structure:\n\n*   USD 69M in managed mandates\n*   3 platforms designed for distinct objectives\n*   7 key sectors within the [REDACTED:ORG] architecture\n*   5 regions with deployed programs across Latin America\n*   A consistent philosophy guides our asset selection\n\n**Our Strategic Partners**\n\n**I. Our Platforms and Integrated Architecture**\n\nOur regulatory framework is supported by strategic alliances with investment banks, global custodians, trust companies, and fund administrators, which contribute to asset protection, regulatory compliance, and the prevention of financial crimes.\n\nOur operational framework consists of three platforms with complementary structures, designed to operate within the global financial landscape.\n\n*   **Monetary Platform — Moneix**\n    Systematic global liquidity protocol operating across multiple markets, distributed through SMAs, private funds, and trust units.\n\n*   **Real Estate Platform — FIBRA**\n    Private real estate investment platform designed with the objective of providing recurring income and potential resilience through flexible fiduciary structures, either collective or segregated trusts.\n\n*   **SMA Platform**\n    [REDACTED:ORG]’s core institutional offering: segregated mandates where Family Offices and institutions may delegate the management of their comprehensive portfolios.\n\n**Partners Supporting Our Institutional Execution**\n\nOur infrastructure is supported by strategic alliances with institutions. Fund administrators such as Apex Group, prime brokers including Jefferies Financial Group and Interactive Brokers, and trust companies provide support for our operations.\n\n**Diversification and Our Structured Approach**\n\nEach platform contributes to the construction of portfolios. We aim to provide access to a diversified set of platforms with presence across relevant strategic markets.\n\n**II. Client Focus and Our Approach**\n\nEngaging with [REDACTED:ORG] means working within a structured framework. Our metrics and platforms are designed with clear objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], we manage capital with a focus on long-term perspective, discipline, independence, and defined objectives, similar to how we approach client relationships.\n\nWe aim to support our clients through a platform designed to facilitate decisions with strategic insight, technical analysis, and alignment of interests.", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\nHere's a revised version of your marketing copy, updated for SEC RIA compliance while preserving your original intent and voice:\n\n---\n\n**Current Market Volatility, Tariffs, and Your Investments**\n\nDear [REDACTED:NAME]:\n\nAn airline pilot once described flying as “long stretches of boredom, interspersed with brief moments of sheer panic.” While we are certainly not suggesting that recent financial market activity warrants panic, you may be wondering how current events could relate to your investments.\n\nPresident [REDACTED:NAME] made the imposition of tariffs on various US trading partners one of the central themes of his campaign.

Are there historical precedents that can offer perspective? And what insights can be drawn for long-term portfolio considerations?\n\n---\n\n**Market Volatility: An Expected Feature**\n\nThose who have been invested in the markets for any length of time recognize that market volatility is—to use a phrase from software design—not a bug, but a feature. Financial markets represent the ongoing, collective decisions (rational and irrational) of millions of buyers and sellers worldwide. Prices move up or down as market participants react to a constant flow of information. While some periods may be relatively quiet, dramatic movements can sometimes occur in mere hours. As illustrated in historical data, market downturns have been a regular occurrence, even as the stock market has demonstrated strong long-term returns.\n\nSOURCE: Vanguard, Inc.\n\n---\n\n**Attempting to Time the Market is Extremely Challenging**\n\nThere is a well-known market proverb: “Time IN the market is more important than timing the market.” Historically, investors who have maintained a disciplined approach—even in the face of short-term downside volatility—have often fared well over the longer term, including during pullbacks, corrections, or bear markets.\n\nThe challenge with market timing is its demanding precision; being incorrect even a small percentage of the time can significantly impact returns. The illustration below highlights the potential impact for a hypothetical investor who allocated $1 million to the stock market on January 1, 1990. If that investment remained in place until December 31, 2024, it would have hypothetically grown to $34 million. If, in an attempt to time the market, the investor missed just the SINGLE best day, the hypothetical return could be $3.5 million lower ($30.5 million). Missing the 25 best days would have hypothetically reduced the portfolio return by $26.8 million ($7.2 million), even assuming the investor's daily market calls were hypothetically correct an astonishing 99.67% of the time.\n\n*This illustration is hypothetical and does not represent actual performance. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes. Past performance, hypothetical or otherwise, is not indicative of future results.*\n\nFor these reasons, we continue to advise that a consistent, long-term approach is generally considered effective for pursuing the potential of your investments, rather than attempting to consistently and accurately time market movements.\n\n---\n\n**Historical Market Resilience**\n\nThis is not the first challenging period investors have encountered. Examining the historical record offers perspective on the long-term resilience of markets across various crises. Historical data shows, for instance, how $1 invested in the MSCI World Index (a measure of total global stock markets) grew to almost $110 over a 54-year period, despite temporary disruptions caused by crises such as the Arab oil embargo in 1973 or the COVID pandemic in 2022. While markets may experience declines in the immediate aftermath of such events, they have historically demonstrated a tendency to recover over time as the global economy adapts to new circumstances.\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of advisory fees, transaction costs, or taxes.*\n\nSOURCE: Dimensional Funds\n\n---\n\n**The Role of Well-Diversified Portfolios During Volatile Times**\n\nUltimately, the performance of your individual portfolio is what matters most to you.

Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This **will unequivocally** offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially.

Yet, time and again as I reviewed tax returns with clients and their accountants, I consistently observed missed opportunities for tax optimization.\n\nWhile visiting my son at law school, I recall reading an article that highlighted how retirees were often paying more in taxes than necessary because their investments and tax plans were not coordinated. I realized this was a common issue among my own clients.\n\nIn the past, I'd see a retirement plan that seemed sound on paper, but when we examined the actual tax return, critical pieces were often disconnected. Opportunities for Roth conversions might be overlooked. Charitable giving strategies could be missed. Required minimum distributions were frequently handled in the simplest way, rather than the most tax-efficient.\n\nOur office would offer suggestions, but the ultimate decisions typically rested with a financial advisor working directly with a client’s CPA, often without a truly integrated, long-term strategy.\n\nThe more I witnessed this disconnect, the clearer it became that retirees needed a dedicated tax planning partner focused on their entire retirement journey—not just a preparer focused on last year's numbers.\n\n**Right column:**\n\n**A PERSONAL INSIGHT**\n\nA few years ago, I sought a second opinion on my own taxes. Initially, my situation didn't seem more complex than many of my clients'. I simply wanted to ensure I wasn't overlooking anything.\n\nWhen the reviewing CPA completed their analysis, they explained that due to the structure of my income and investments, I had a potential opportunity to manage my tax liability more efficiently over the coming years.\n\nThat realization was impactful.\n\nIf someone deeply involved in retirement planning could identify such potential inefficiencies, it underscored the challenges faced by everyday retirees without a background in finance or tax law.\n\nThat experience prompted me to re-evaluate my practice. I recognized my clients needed someone to sit on the same side of the table with them, coordinating their retirement income and tax strategy year after year—proactively, rather than just reconciling numbers after the fact.\n\nThat's when the vision for [REDACTED:ORG] truly began to take shape.\n\n**Visuals**\n*   Bottom left: a photograph of a rustic house or cabin with a steep roof, shown at an angle, surrounded by trees and a body of water. The image is slightly tilted, giving a dramatic feel (possibly symbolizing a \"house\" or \"plan\" off-kilter).\n*   Background uses white space with red and blue accent shapes similar to Page 1.\n\n---\n\n**Page 3**\n\n**Text**\n\n**Top left:**\n\n**A DIFFERENT VISION: TWO CONVERSATIONS, NOT ONE**\n\nThis realization led us to fundamentally rethink how tax planning could work. The cheapest option isn't always the most beneficial, and a tax refund doesn't necessarily mean you're paying the minimum amount allowed by law. Instead of treating taxes as one annual event, we believe in making it two distinct but equally important conversations.\n\n**Conversation One** happens before your return is filed. It focuses on proactive, compliant tax planning—ensuring your income, investments, and retirement strategy are coordinated so you potentially don't pay more than you legally owe. This is the foundation—getting the compliance piece right.\n\n**Conversation Two** takes place after the busy tax season to create a proactive roadmap. We review the past year’s outcomes and strategize for the years to come, especially as you approach and navigate retirement.\n\nWhen your tax professional and your retirement advisor collaborate, looking forward instead of backwards, significant tax planning opportunities may emerge.\n\n**Mid-right:**\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF**\n**[REDACTED:ORG]**\n\nThis vision became the foundation of [REDACTED:ORG]. We aimed to be more than just a firm that processes numbers once a year—we sought to partner with retirees and their financial advisors to build a long-term tax strategy.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established to serve retirees and pre-retirees who desire more than a single annual tax appointment. We exist to help you:\n\n*   Understand how your retirement income streams may affect your taxes.\n*   Coordinate your investment, income, and tax planning strategies.\n*   Explore opportunities permitted by the tax code.\n*   Avoid potential missteps that could lead to unexpected tax liabilities.\n\nOur goal is straightforward: to provide you with confidence that your tax strategy is handled with the same care and foresight as the rest of your retirement plan.\n\n**[REDACTED:ORG]—Guarding Your Wealth**\n\n**Bottom left:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]\n\n(logo text)\n\n**Visuals**\n*   Top-right image: close-up of hands of business people at a desk looking at charts and graphs with pens and a tablet or laptop—typical “financial meeting” visuals, including line graphs and bar charts.\n*   Bottom left: the [REDACTED:ORG] shield logo (blue shield with red top, white star, and the firm name in white text).\n*   Red and dark blue diagonal shapes at top and bottom echo the brand colors.\n\n---\n\n**Page 4**\n\n**Text**\n\n**EVALUATING YOUR RETIREMENT TAX STRATEGY**\nHere are 10 common signs it might be time to make a change—and consider a Retirement Tax Specialist.\n\nThen a 2-column grid with 10 numbered items:\n1.  **LACK OF PROACTIVE TAX PLANNING**\n    If your accountant only contacts you when it’s time to file, their focus may be on last year—not the years ahead. Effective tax planning looks forward.\n    Red Flag Question: “What should I be doing now to potentially reduce next year’s tax bill?” If they don’t have a clear answer, that could be a concern.\n2.  **LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF RETIREMENT INCOME**\n    Retirement income streams differ significantly from your working years. Pensions, Social Security, IRA withdrawals, and investments all have distinct tax considerations.\n    Red Flag Question: “Can you illustrate the most tax-efficient strategies for drawing income from my retirement accounts?”\n3.  **POOR COMMUNICATION OR RESPONSIVENESS**\n    Unreturned calls or emails, last-minute requests for documents, or rushed appointments can indicate that your current advisor may be overextended or disorganized.\n    Red Flag Question: “What is your typical response time when I have a tax question during the year?”\n4.  **ERRORS OR MISSED DEADLINES**\n    Late filings, amended returns, or preventable IRS notices are significant warning signs.\n    Red Flag Question: “What processes do you have in place to help prevent mistakes before my return is filed?”\n5.  **FAILURE TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER PROFESSIONALS**\n    Your financial advisor, attorney, and tax professional ideally should function as a cohesive team. If your tax advisor is unwilling to collaborate, you might be left managing disjointed advice.\n    Red Flag Question: “Are you willing to work directly with my financial advisor to help ensure my tax plan and retirement plan are aligned?”\n6.  **UNCLEAR EXPLANATIONS**\n    If you leave meetings more confused than when you arrived, that’s a problem. You deserve clear explanations in plain language.\n    Red Flag Question: “Can you walk me through my tax return and explain the major numbers in a way I can easily understand?”\n7.  **NOT UP-TO-DATE WITH TAX LAW CHANGES**\n    Tax laws change frequently, particularly concerning retirement accounts and Social Security. Your tax professional should be proactive in understanding and applying updates.\n    Red Flag Question: “How might recent tax law changes affect my retirement strategy?”\n8.  **VALUE CONCERNS**\n    Fees should align with the value you receive. If you primarily receive an annual filing without ongoing planning, you may be overpaying for the scope of services.\n    Red Flag Question: “What ongoing planning or review is included in the fee I pay each year?”\n9.  **ABSENCE OF LONG-TERM PLANNING**\n    If your tax professional focuses only on last year's numbers and never discusses the next 5–10 years, they may not be helping you build a comprehensive retirement tax strategy.\n    Red Flag Question: “What is your strategy to help me manage taxes as I move through retirement and face required minimum distributions?”\n10. **OUTGROWN YOUR CURRENT ADVISOR**\n    Perhaps your financial situation has become more complex, or your assets have grown, but your tax strategy hasn't evolved to keep pace.\n    Red Flag Question: “Given my current financial situation, do you believe you are still the optimal fit for my tax planning needs—or should I consider a retirement tax specialist?”\n\n**Visuals**\n*   Dark red header bar at the top with the main title in white.\n*   The 10 items are laid out in a dark blue box grid, with white text and thin dividing lines.\n*   Each numbered item has a short bold heading and smaller explanatory text.\n\n---\n\n**Page 5**\n\n**Text**\n\n**YOUR RETIREMENT DESERVES A STRATEGIC TAX PARTNER.**\n\nDiscover how collaborating with [REDACTED:ORG] can help you potentially avoid costly missteps and build long-term financial confidence.\n\n**Subheading box:**\n\n**STRATEGIES TO OPTIMIZE YOUR TAXES IN RETIREMENT**\n\nTaxes don’t disappear when you retire—they often become more complex. Instead of a straightforward paycheck with automatic withholding, you may now have a patchwork of Social Security, pensions, investment income, and IRA or 401(k) withdrawals. Without a well-coordinated plan, you could face higher taxes, increased Medicare premiums, or unexpected IRS obligations.\n\nOur comprehensive tax planning process is designed to help you legally minimize what you pay in taxes over the course of your retirement.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Based on our experience, we observe that companies we classify as high-quality often tend to perform favorably during market recoveries. This strategic focus was intended to provide a measure of confidence during the volatile downturn, which assisted us in maintaining and selectively adding to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nRegarding our specific recommendations, the structured note we selected for client portfolios was called at the beginning of July, generating a 15% return over one year for those holdings. This outcome highlights the precision of our selection process and demonstrates how these instruments effectively drive portfolio growth. We continue to allocate to these notes to replicate this success and provide double-digit upside potential. Our experience with structured note allocations has been consistently positive, and we maintain their role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

It does not represent actual client performance, nor does it reflect the performance of any actual accounts.

There is no guarantee that these results will be achieved, and actual client performance may vary significantly.**\n\n**Hypothetical performance has inherent limitations:**\n*   **It does not involve actual financial risk, and no actual investment decisions were made. Therefore, the results do not reflect the impact of financial risk or the ability to withstand losses.**\n*   **It is often created with the benefit of hindsight, which can allow for the selection of investments or strategies that have performed well in the past.**\n*   **The model does not account for the impact of liquidity constraints, market depth, or certain transaction costs (beyond advisory fees) that actual portfolios would incur.**\n*   **The model may not account for the full impact of taxes or other expenses that would affect actual client portfolios.**\n\n**Assumptions Used in This Illustrative Model:**\n*   **The model assumes specific market conditions, asset class returns, and volatility levels for the entire illustration period (April 1, 2017 - November 7, 2025), including future periods, which may not materialize.**\n*   **Performance returns are presented after advisory fees are deducted, which are assumed to be consistent with FFG's standard fee schedule. Other fees such as custodial fees, transaction charges, and taxes are generally not deducted and would reduce actual returns.**\n*   **The model assumes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.**\n*   **The model may assume a specific rebalancing frequency and methodology.**\n*   **The specific securities listed are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate potential asset types within a hypothetical model portfolio and do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security. The actual selection of securities and their performance within an actual client account would depend on various factors including the client's individual objectives and risk tolerance.**\n*   **Benchmarks used (S&P 500, Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, 90-Day T-Bill, Alternative Blend, 6% Absolute Return) are unmanaged indices and do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning. What may appear similar on the surface often differs significantly in depth, process, and philosophy.\n\nFocused Guidance vs. Broad-Brush Advice\nSome approaches might be suitable for those seeking a more directed path. Others prefer a relationship with a process based upon personalized in-depth insights and patient guidance towards clearly defined goals.\n\nAn Individual Advisor vs. A Team Approach\nMany advisors operate independently, even within the same firm, each earning their own compensation based upon the clients they individually serve and support. Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 6 Others provide clients a dedicated contact backed by a team of experienced professionals who collaborate as one advisor team—working together with a shared focus on client goals. Team members compensated by salary reinforce the team’s focus on clients, not commissions.\n\nCost Consideration vs. Value Realization\nThere are numerous ways financial professionals are compensated. When evaluating the investment, it’s important to understand all fees and carefully evaluate the value provided. While some advisors will focus on potential rates of returns, a holistic planning relationship can offer tax-efficient strategies, tailored investment approaches, and potential value that can often exceed the fees. Ultimately, the least expensive option may not offer the greatest value.\n\nGeneralist vs. Focused Specialist\nMost financial advisors are willing to accept any client willing to work with them, regardless of what their financial needs are. Without boundaries, they may sell car insurance, college savings plans, starter investment plans, and even a templated retirement plan. They fulfill a vital role in serving the mass market, without minimums or qualifiers. [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 7 A smaller number of financial firms serve a specific niche and are selective in accepting clients who align with their field of expertise. These firms specialize in working with a particular type of client—whether it’s working with specific corporate retirement plans, high-net-worth individuals, or those with complex legacy planning needs. This specialization often enables a deeper understanding and more tailored strategies for their specific client needs.\n\nStructured Engagements vs. Flexible Service\nSome advisory relationships involve financial products that come with long-term commitments or restrictions that can hinder your access to your money and limit financial flexibility. Upfront Load Fees and early termination penalties could have serious consequences. Others take a different approach—earning trust and loyalty through service, not long-term contracts or upfront fees. A flexible service model allows clients to retain control of their accounts, with the freedom to make changes without undue penalties or obligations.\n\n9 Types of Financial Plans\nThe term “financial plan” can mean very different things—ranging from a general outline of future expectations to a detailed, evolving strategy. Understanding the differences can help you choose the type of plan—and advisor—that best matches your needs.\n\nTransactional vs. Relational\nMany advisors have a business model built on a sales transaction of a one-time financial plan which might include the sale of a financial product. A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan. While that may be one important component, it leaves out crucial elements. A holistic strategy integrates tax planning, income sequencing, healthcare costs, and legacy goals into a unified framework—where each part supports and reinforces the others. When financial decision-making is done in isolation, important connections are often missed.\n\nGoals-Based vs. Cash Flow-Centered Planning\nGoals-based planning is often centered around future milestones—such as retiring by a certain age or reaching a savings goal. While this helps define purpose, it can fall short when it doesn’t account for the practical logistics of turning savings into income. Cash flow-based planning addresses this by mapping the inflows and outflows of money throughout retirement—tracking not only how much is needed, but when and how it should be distributed. It accounts for timing, taxes, and long-term sustainability, aligning the plan more closely with the day-to-day realities of retirement living.\n\nSimplified vs. Advanced Technology-Driven\nSome financial plans amount to a rough sketch—perhaps a quick projection or self-made spreadsheet [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) 11 estimating retirement income. These may provide basic direction but often lack depth and adaptability. More advanced approaches involve powerful technology that analyzes hundreds of variables—stress-testing income strategies, modeling tax impacts, and projecting future scenarios with enhanced precision. While a simplified plan might help answer “when can I retire?”, a technology-driven strategy guarantees the protection and growth of wealth without risk. Leveraging our proprietary system eliminates the possibility of loss, ensuring your plan's sustainability against any scenario for the full span of retirement and beyond.\n\n13 Choosing the Right Path Forward\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to retirement planning. What matters most is that the guidance you choose reflects the complexity of your financial life and aligns with the level of support you want moving forward.\n\nWhether you’re managing things on your own, working with an advisor, or somewhere in between, this may be the moment to ask: Does my current approach give me the clarity, confidence, and adaptability I’ll need—not just to retire, but to make the most of what’s possible throughout retirement? If you’re seeking a deeper, more integrated approach—one that’s designed to grow with you, adjust to life’s unknowns, and support your goals with strategy and care—the path forward may become clearer.\n\n15 About The Author [REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R)\n[REDACTED:NAME], CFP(R) is the Lead Financial Planner at [REDACTED:ORG], where she leads a team of advisors focused on comprehensive retirement planning.

Some people prefer to manage things themselves, staying in control of their investments and decisions. Others seek out an advisor for expert input or a second opinion. And some choose to form an ongoing relationship with a professional who can help guide them through every stage—investments, taxes, income strategies, and legacy planning.\n\nAdvisors and planning styles vary widely. Some offer limited investment guidance, while others take a more comprehensive approach that integrates tax planning, estate strategy, and long-term income design. The scope of services, the depth of analysis, and even the advisor’s strategic philosophy can differ significantly—potentially impacting the outcomes. While cost is often a consideration, it’s important to recognize that value isn’t always visible on the surface. What may appear to be a simple, low-cost solution could end Finding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 2 up falling short if it lacks the structure or support needed for the complexities of retirement. That’s why choosing the right kind of financial guidance—and the right kind of relationship—matters. We believe asking the right questions can help reveal the path that fits you best—and ensure that your financial guidance matches the life you want to live.\n\n3 Evaluating The Self-Managed Approach\nMany individuals take pride in handling their own investments and financial decisions. When retirement introduces new layers of complexity, including tax efficiency, income planning, and healthcare costs, it’s important to re-assess if this will continue to be prudent.\n\nManual Research and Analysis vs. Professional-Grade Software Tools\nSome are comfortable with relying on intensive efforts in research and utilizing publicly available resources in self-managing their finances. Others consider the potential benefits of professionals utilizing an array of advisor-exclusive, professional-grade software tools to produce detailed data and projections that support a precise and informed strategy.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 4\nSelf-Reliance vs. Professional Team Oversight\nSome value the autonomy of self-managing finances, trusting their retirement to their personal efforts. Others find confidence in the collaborative oversight—maintaining ownership of their plan while benefiting from a team who brings added insight, accountability, and coordination.\n\nSolo Stewardship vs. Shared Continuity\nFor those who manage everything themselves, the plan often lives in their head or on their desktop. Others recognize the peace of mind that comes with a team already up to speed—ready to support a spouse or family if needed, without scrambling or starting from scratch.\n\nSubject Matter Mastery vs. Holistic Expertise\nSome individuals have achieved success with a solid knowledge of investment strategies. They may be tempted to tackle the complexity of the new challenges that come with retirement planning. Others prefer a professional that is well versed in the latest developments involving tax codes, cash-flow planning, RMD rules, estate planning, Medicare timelines, and more. Beyond an investment strategy, all of these aspects of financial planning benefit from strategic holistic balancing.\n\n5 Comparison Shopping for an Advisor\nWhether you already have an advisor or are currently exploring your options, it’s important to recognize that not all advisors offer the same level of planning.

A static plan may offer a sense of direction that serves as a starting point and offers little in the way of course corrections over time. A different dynamic is found in the ongoing support of an advisor relationship, and it appeals to those that wish to have consistent professional oversight to keep a financial plan on target and adapted and refined through changing financial, tax, and market landscapes, as well as life changes.\n\nFinding Your Starting Point for a Successful Retirement Journey 10\nInvestment-Only vs. Holistic Integration\nSome advisors create investment plans focused solely on growth or protection and may consider that the extent of a financial plan.

Many employees seek greater access, additional support, and tangible indicators of employer commitment to their well-being. Concurrently, employers navigate rising healthcare costs, increasing premiums, and evolving retention challenges.\n\nA class of modern supplemental health plans is emerging to address these dynamics. These policies differ from traditional accident or critical illness plans. They aim to provide practical, everyday benefits designed to help address common gaps in major medical coverage. Furthermore, they may offer new avenues for brokers and advisors to support their clients.\n\n⸻\n\nLeft column – author box under photo\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], CEO and founder of [REDACTED:ORG], a benefit solutions firm.

For more information, visit [REDACTED:URL].\n\n⸻\n\nCenter column subheading\n\nIdentifying the benefit gap\n\nBody text under “Identifying the benefit gap”\n\nHigh deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and logistical barriers can create situations where having coverage does not always translate to timely care. This can lead to preventable conditions going unmanaged, employees delaying prescriptions or urgent care visits. The potential outcomes include worsening long-term health, increased absenteeism, and decreased productivity. The challenge often lies not just in whether employees have coverage, but whether that coverage adequately supports them when care is needed.\n\n⸻\n\nRight column subheading\n\nA modern approach to supplemental coverage\n\nBody text and bullet list\n\nModern supplemental health plans often adopt a different approach. Rather than exclusively focusing on rare or catastrophic events, these plans are frequently designed for more common, everyday use. Examples of features that may be offered include:\n\n*   Potential $0 copay for primary care doctor visits*\n*   Mental health support options*\n*   Potential $0 copay prescription drug access*\n*   Virtual care access*\n*   In-person urgent care coverage*\n*   Lab testing options*\n*   Annual preventive visits*\n\n*   *Specific benefits and features can vary significantly by plan, provider, and location. Please refer to individual plan details for exact coverage.*\n\nA key aspect of these plans is their potential for integration. They are not intended to replace major medical care but rather to help alleviate common pressure points.

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, maintaining principal stability without fluctuation while gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder that market timing can be difficult; investors who maintained their positions through the downturn may have experienced the subsequent market rebound, while those who sold might have foregone potential participation in the recovery.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nThis blog is published by [REDACTED:ORG].
