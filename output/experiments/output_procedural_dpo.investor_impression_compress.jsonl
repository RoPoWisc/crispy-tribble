Our Approach**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser that combines institutional capabilities with a focus on markets, aiming to integrate regional presence with established management practices.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was established with the goal of creating a platform that offers access, robust processes, and governance in capital management. Since its inception, the firm has developed solutions designed to complement traditional portfolios of professional investors through strategies structured under operational frameworks and internationally recognized standards.\n\nThis approach has led to the development of independent platforms designed to address various client needs within a global and regulated environment. Each platform is structured with specific objectives and aims for adaptability and long-term viability.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our investment approach involves analyzing market conditions to identify opportunities, with the objective of preserving value for clients, and facilitating access to relevant investments, all supported by institutional execution principles.\n\n**II. Our Structured Capabilities**\n\nWe believe that managing financial objectives requires a structured approach that translates client goals into tailored solutions.\n\nTo achieve this, we have developed a framework that supports capital management with defined processes, flexibility, and comprehensive understanding, integrating two complementary capabilities:\n\n**Wealth Advisory**, for private and institutional clients seeking tailored wealth planning, access to institutional platforms, and specialized guidance.\n\n**Investment Advisory**, focused on structuring and monitoring investment strategies within multi-asset platforms, utilizing a disciplined execution approach.\n\nThis framework allows us to translate client objectives into actionable decisions and strategies.\n\nWe aim to support client financial journeys through a platform designed to be responsive, adaptable, and evolutionary.\n\n**III. Our Philosophy**\n\nEffective capital management involves designing solutions tailored to client objectives.\n\nAt [REDACTED:ORG], our asset management approach combines independent analysis, specialized knowledge, and a connected platform.\n\nOur solutions are developed based on an understanding of our clients' objectives and priorities. Our approach aims to translate individual needs into well-structured, adaptable solutions.\n\nWe focus on designing solutions rather than merely offering products. We aim to interpret market conditions rather than simply replicating strategies.\n\nEach solution is integrated into a coherent financial plan, designed to adapt over time.\n\n**IV. The [REDACTED:ORG] Framework**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]’s operational platform integrates specialized personnel, technology, and partnerships within an infrastructure designed to support complex decisions with established processes and controls.\n\nEach component, from analysis to execution, follows defined processes that aim for efficiency, traceability, and consistency. This system is designed to facilitate operations with a focus on precision, adaptability, and alignment between objectives and actions.\n\nThis integration of human expertise, technology, and governance frameworks supports financial decision-making, aiming for long-term consistency and operational resilience.\n\n**V.

Trustees and fund administrators help ensure compliance with each vehicle’s purpose, its investment policies, and the limits defined by specialized committees.\n\n**IV.

Each month, we collaborate with external resources, including our AE Wealth consultants, and other investment professionals to assess recent economic trends and their potential impact on financial markets. We aim to provide these regular updates as an informational resource.\n\n**Portfolios**\nFor the quarter, [REDACTED:ORG]'s portfolios generated positive returns, net of fees and expenses. A broad range of underlying holdings within the portfolios achieved positive results, reflecting strength across multiple market segments during the period. While growth-focused assets generally performed well, areas such as Value, Hedged Equity, and Small Caps also contributed positively. Active Fixed Income positions, when considered net of fees, contributed to performance relative to a broad-market bond index. Diversifying assets, such as Gold, also contributed positively to overall performance.\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results and cannot guarantee future investment outcomes.*\n\n**Market Outlook**\nThe third quarter of [REDACTED:DATE] experienced a reduction in market volatility compared to the first half of the year, as markets navigated tariff uncertainties and policy challenges. This resilience led to new market highs during Q3, illustrating the potential benefits of a patient, long-term investment perspective. Our current outlook suggests that stocks *could* continue to see modest gains through the end of the year, supported by factors such as strong corporate earnings reports, a rebound in GDP during the second quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s recent adjustments to interest rates. *These are forward-looking statements based on current information and expectations, and actual results may differ materially.*\n\n**Looking Ahead**\nAs we approach the final quarter of [REDACTED:DATE], several key factors are expected to influence market performance. A primary focus remains the trajectory of Federal Reserve interest rate policy, which continues to be a subject of uncertainty amid mixed economic data and evolving political considerations. While the Fed *might* still implement further rate adjustments this year, ongoing concerns related to trade policy, deficit spending, and broader national sentiment are anticipated to influence the bond market in the coming months. The sustainability of economic growth is another critical consideration, particularly given the observed differences between strong GDP figures and softer employment trends. How the economy sustains its momentum or responds to potential policy interventions will be important to monitor.\n\nIn this environment, maintaining investment discipline and focusing on long-term objectives remains crucial. While the remainder of [REDACTED:DATE] may present ongoing challenges for investors, historical market behavior suggests that those who maintain patience and adhere to their strategic plan are often better positioned to pursue their financial goals.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n*This material is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.

The recent market movements were considerable and may have caused some investors to feel uncertain. Individuals or entities without a defined investment strategy prior to significant market shifts may find themselves reacting rather than acting proactively. In our view, placing the current market environment within a broader historical and economic context is crucial. This approach assists us in evaluating market realities and calibrating portfolios, aiming to prevent overemphasis on any single event or news item. Our goal is to maintain a long-term investment mindset while remaining aware of the market’s evolving dynamics. Achieving this balance can be challenging but is generally considered highly important for potentially contributing to long-term investment success.\n\nAs we discussed in our last quarterly communication, in our view, fundamental economic conditions have not drastically altered since the beginning of the year. Instead, we believe that evolving investor perceptions and interpretations of current events have largely driven recent market volatility. While recent market fluctuations have lessened, we do not believe that market volatility is permanently absent. During periods of relative calm, it can be beneficial to consider enduring investment principles. These are lessons that investors may encounter repeatedly during turbulent periods. Reviewing these principles can help investors navigate future market downturns that may arise.\n\n### The Challenges of Market Timing\n\nHistorically, remaining invested throughout market cycles has been widely considered a significant factor for long-term investment strategies. A common challenge with attempting to time the market lies not always in the initial decision to sell to avoid a downturn, but often in the subsequent attempt to re-enter. Investors may become anchored to recent low prices, finding it difficult to buy back into the market at higher levels during a recovery. Common internal narratives might include, \"This is just a short-term bounce; the markets will retest the lows,\" or \"I don't want to chase the rally—I'll wait for another dip to buy back in.\" During the early stages of a market recovery, investors often exhibit skepticism and may believe they can accurately predict the bottom for re-entry.\n\nBased on our observations, attempts to time the market by sidestepping downturns have, in many cases, resulted in missed opportunities during subsequent recoveries, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes than remaining invested. This challenge partly stems from the asymmetrical nature of market returns: while potential downside is limited to the amount invested (assuming no leverage), the potential for upside returns is theoretically unlimited. In other words, the maximum potential loss is the initial investment, but the amount that can be gained has no theoretical upper bound. Although potential upside may not be as easily quantifiable as immediate losses, it can be a vastly important consideration and is generally only achievable by remaining invested. Unfortunately, many investors' attention may be drawn to easily measured losses, which can lead to potentially inopportune investment decisions. Attempts to avoid drawdowns, such as 20% or 30%, can risk missing out on significant potential gains during market recoveries, as historically observed.\n\nThe recent market recovery serves as an illustration. Its rapid ascent may have surprised some investors, and those not positioned in the market may have missed out on initial gains. For investors who exited the market, the challenge often becomes re-entering at an opportune time. Waiting for the \"right time\" can lead to watching the market advance and potentially re-entering at higher prices, thus potentially foregoing a portion of subsequent gains. This scenario highlights a common challenge in market timing.\n\n### The Role of Asset Allocation\n\nEstablishing an appropriate asset allocation strategy can be instrumental in fostering resilience during periods of market stress and uncertainty. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the year, many portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] generally maintained an approximate 50% equity exposure, with the remainder allocated to diversified assets such as fixed income, gold, structured notes, and a significant cash position. This diversified allocation was designed to contribute to patience and stability during challenging market conditions. A notable portion of these portfolios comprised assets intended to offer diversification or exhibit a lower correlation to equity market performance, thereby aiming to potentially enhance portfolio stability.\n\nFurthermore, within the equity component of portfolios, our goal is to focus on companies we identify as high-quality. Because we restrict our selection to these high-quality names, our portfolios are naturally immune to the significant drawdowns that plague the broader market. This strategic focus provided certainty during the volatile downturn, allowing us to maintain and selectively add to equity exposure when market sentiment was broadly negative. Proactively structuring portfolios for potential volatility is a significant aspect of our investment strategy. While past performance is not indicative of future results, this approach is designed to help mitigate downside risk, enable the capture of potential opportunities, and support portfolio recovery. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives.\n\n### A Note on Structured Notes\n\nAs an example, some portfolios managed by [REDACTED:ORG] held a structured note that was called at the beginning of July, which resulted in an approximate 15% return over one year for those specific holdings. **Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that similar results will be achieved.** This serves as an illustration of a structured note potentially performing in line with its design parameters. Our experience with structured note allocations has been generally positive, and we continue to evaluate their potential role within diversified portfolios.\n\nThe current structured note portfolio is designed with the objective of providing periodic liquidity, though actual liquidity and timing may vary. We aim for the aggregate structured note allocation to contribute to our objectives for return and liquidity, which we seek to utilize for potential future opportunities. However, structured notes involve various risks, and their performance is not guaranteed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[REDACTED:NAME], [REDACTED:ID]\nCOO, [REDACTED:ORG]\n\n---\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] DBA [REDACTED:ORG] is registered as an investment adviser and only conducts business in jurisdictions where it is properly registered or is excluded or exempted from registration requirements.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks. Through our 3(38) services, we accept fiduciary responsibility for investment selection and ongoing monitoring, providing full discretion over these decisions. This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services strive to provide a carefully selected 401(k) lineup. Our approach utilizes advanced technology for objective investment analysis, aiming to minimize potential biases often associated with proprietary mutual funds. Our process focuses on selecting and monitoring investments in the best interest of your plan. Each month, we evaluate fund performance, costs, and suitability, with the goal of keeping your lineup optimized and aligned with your plan's objectives.\n\n**Participant-Focused Financial Planning**\nMany employees may not fully recognize the potential value of their 401(k) plan. Our commitment is to offer guidance designed to help participants make informed retirement decisions. We provide resources such as one-on-one meetings, educational workshops, and holistic financial planning support, aiming to empower participants in their personal finance journey. We strive to help employees build confidence in their financial future while supporting your plan's adherence to fiduciary best practices.\n\n**Comprehensive Fee Benchmarking**\nOur Fee Benchmarking Service is designed to help assess whether your 401(k) plan’s fees are competitive, transparent, and aligned with industry standards. We conduct comprehensive cost analysis, comparing your plan’s expenses to similar plans to help identify potential efficiencies and improvements. Through our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we seek to help you optimize services and strive for expenses that provide value to your business and employees.\n\nYour Plan. Your Goals. Our Priority.\n\n---\n\n**Managing 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities**\n\nAs a plan sponsor, overseeing your company’s 401(k) plan involves significant fiduciary responsibilities. Failure to adequately address these duties can lead to increased scrutiny and potential financial risk. Our 401(k) Services are designed to help plan sponsors manage their fiduciary responsibilities and support compliance, aiming to provide you with greater peace of mind to focus on your business.\n\n**How We May Help Manage Fiduciary Responsibilities:**\n\n**1. Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement effectively eliminates the plan sponsor’s investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. Since we take full discretion, you are no longer liable for investment results.\n\n**2. Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework**\nERISA outlines crucial fiduciary duties. Our 4-pillar framework is designed to help plan sponsors develop and implement a robust governance process, aiming to support the integration of fiduciary best practices within your plan management.\n\n**Your Partner in Fiduciary Support**\nBy leveraging our experience, we aim to help you manage fiduciary responsibilities while striving to maintain a quality retirement plan for your employees.

Goal-Oriented.\n\nOur goal is for your 401(k) lineup to feature carefully selected investment options, utilizing advanced technology to support an objective analysis process. Our disciplined approach prioritizes your plan’s best interests through rigorous selection and monitoring, aiming to provide participants with access to quality investment options.\n\n**How We Approach Your 401(k) Lineup Management:**\n\n**Objective Fund Selection**\nWe employ a data-driven approach to select funds based on factors like historical performance, risk characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. Our process aims to be free from conflicts of interest and proprietary biases.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring**\nEach month, we assess fund performance against appropriate benchmarks and other criteria. Our methodology aims to identify and address options that may no longer align with the plan's objectives, supporting a robust and competitive investment lineup.\n\n**Cost & Suitability Analysis**\nWe evaluate expense ratios, management fees, and overall fund efficiency. Our objective is to seek to minimize costs where appropriate, while maintaining quality investment choices that align with your organization's objectives.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to help support compliance with ERISA and other fiduciary standards, assisting plan sponsors in meeting their legal obligations while seeking to support positive participant outcomes.\n\n**Participant-Focused Approach**\nWe aim to provide education and tools to empower employees in making informed retirement decisions, helping them work towards their long-term financial goals.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Technology-Driven Analysis**\nAdvanced analytics support our fund selection and monitoring process, aiming for informed investment decisions.\n\n**Transparency & Accountability**\nWe act in the best interests of your plan, striving to provide transparency in our fund selection process and ongoing updates.\n\n**Experienced Guidance & Support**\nOur experienced team is dedicated to supporting you and your employees with customized insights and ongoing education.\n\nWith our investment management approach, your 401(k) investment lineup is designed to be strategic and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

We believe a well-supported retirement plan can be a valuable tool in pursuing long-term financial security. Our commitment is to provide guidance and resources designed to help employees make informed retirement decisions. By engaging with their 401(k) plan, employees may potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth, employer contributions, and a structured path towards retirement.\n\nEmployers often dedicate significant resources to offering competitive contributions. We focus on helping employees understand the potential impact of these contributions. Through educational tools, we aim to illustrate how employer contributions may grow over time and highlight their meaningful role in strengthening long-term financial security.\n\n**Our Educational Support and Activities:**\nTo help ensure your 401(k) education program remains relevant, we recommend a structured approach to developing and implementing educational initiatives. This approach aims to follow a consistent process that allows for periodic adjustments in response to changes in plan features, participant priorities, and the broader economic landscape. We offer personalized support through:\n\n*   **One-on-One Meetings:** Tailored guidance to help align retirement goals with financial strategies. These meetings aim to allow employees to ask specific questions, set goals, and adjust their strategies as their financial needs evolve.\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Providing insights on saving, investing, and retirement readiness. Our workshops may cover topics such as Social Security considerations, market insights, tax-efficient investing principles, and strategies for retirement income planning.\n*   **Holistic Financial Planning Support:** Assistance in considering how 401(k) contributions fit into overall financial wellness.

This process is designed to help uncover potential opportunities for enhanced cost efficiency, improved service value, and potentially better plan outcomes.\n\n**Fee Transparency Review**\nWe aim to provide a clear, itemized breakdown of costs, striving for transparency so you can understand the components of your plan's expenses.\n\n**Competitive Pricing Information**\nThrough our Fee Due Diligence Procedure, we may solicit proposals from multiple service providers to help assess competitive pricing. This process includes evaluating provider qualifications, assessing the scope and quality of services offered, and analyzing cost structures, with the goal of maximizing the value of plan expenses while maintaining quality service for your business and employees.\n\n**Regulatory Support & Fiduciary Guidance**\nOur process is designed to align with current DOL guidance and industry considerations, aiming to help plan sponsors fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities regarding reasonable plan fees.\n\n**Why Consider Us?**\n\n**Independent & Objective Analysis**\nWe operate with independence, focusing on objective fee assessments and provider recommendations without proprietary conflicts of interest.\n\n**Deep Industry Experience**\nOur team brings extensive experience in retirement plan consulting, providing insights and strategic guidance tailored to your plan’s needs.\n\n**Proactive Cost Management Support**\nWe monitor market trends and provider pricing, helping you stay informed about fee structures and potentially identify cost-effective solutions.\n\nWith our fee benchmarking support, your 401(k) plan is intended to be cost-effective, supported for compliance, and aligned with the financial well-being of your participants, contributing to their long-term financial journey.\n\nYour Plan.

Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This *could potentially help* offset profit margin pressure for companies unable to fully pass through import costs from higher tariffs. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

At [REDACTED:ORG], we aim to help manage and mitigate these risks.

This approach is designed to reduce the plan sponsor's investment-related fiduciary burden.\n\nOur Fiduciary Four Pillar Framework is designed to help establish robust governance and best practices, aiming to provide you with greater clarity and allowing you to focus on your core business.\n\n**Objective Investment Lineup Management**\nOur Investment Management services guarantee a highly profitable 401(k) lineup.

Investment Fiduciary (3(38) Services)**\nWhile any entity can claim fiduciary status, the actual responsibilities are defined by actions. Section 3(38) of ERISA designates an “investment manager” as a fiduciary responsible for overseeing and managing the plan’s investment assets. We formally accept the role of a 3(38) investment fiduciary in writing, thereby assuming discretionary responsibility for investment selection and monitoring. This arrangement is intended to help reduce the plan sponsor’s specific investment-related fiduciary exposure, allowing you to potentially reallocate time and focus to other aspects of your business. *Please note that a plan sponsor always retains certain fiduciary duties, such as the initial selection and ongoing monitoring of the 3(38) investment manager.*\n\n**2.

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder that market timing can be difficult; investors who maintained their positions through the downturn may have experienced the subsequent market rebound, while those who sold might have foregone potential participation in the recovery.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Important Disclosures:**\n\nThis blog is published by [REDACTED:ORG].

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME]. They recognized similar skill sets and a shared passion for serving investors, leading them to develop a strategic alliance to collaborate for the benefit of their clients.\n\nUnfortunately, [REDACTED:NAME] passed away due to complications associated with his condition on July 1st, [REDACTED:DATE]. [REDACTED:NAME] is honored to continue the legacy of [REDACTED:NAME] by serving as a dedicated advisor for both the clients of [REDACTED:ORG] and [REDACTED:ORG]. [REDACTED:ORG] has since merged with [REDACTED:ORG], and going forward, we will operate solely as [REDACTED:ORG].\n\nToday, [REDACTED:ORG] is dedicated to helping clients pursue their financial goals through The Wealth Empowerment Program.\n\n---\n\n## Our People\n\n### OUR CONSULTANTS\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME], CRPC®, CMFC®, AIF**\nFinancial Consultant\n\n[REDACTED:NAME] has been enthusiastically committed to providing personalized wealth management solutions to his clients for nearly two decades. Throughout this time, he has had what he calls ‘a front row seat’ in observing client progress and the impact of tailored guidance based on a true understanding of each client’s unique needs. He believes the foundation of all financial planning and progress begins with having a comprehensive wealth management plan in place – one that addresses all aspects of planning and preparing for significant life events. This includes planning for retirement, navigating retirement, addressing unexpected illness or loss, funding children/grandchildren’s education, and much more.\n\nBefore beginning his career in the financial services field, [REDACTED:NAME] graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance from Auburn University. He immediately began working in the financial services industry in back-office services and product development. Soon after, his skills led him to an external sales role for several mutual fund, 401(k), and annuity carriers. [REDACTED:NAME] focused on providing financial advisors with retirement income options to offer their retail clients, aiming to provide financial clarity.\n\nIn [REDACTED:DATE], [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] to pursue his passion for helping others plan for and work towards financial independence, and he continues to do so as the President of [REDACTED:ORG]. He holds the Certified Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC) designation, the Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor (CMFC) designation through the College for Financial Planning, and is an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF).\n\n**More About [REDACTED:NAME]**\n[REDACTED:NAME] is married to his wife of [REDACTED:DATE] years, [REDACTED:NAME], and they have two children.

Our purpose is to strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n\nThe firm was formed by the merger of two firms based in [REDACTED:ADDRESS]. [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] in 2001. As he described it, \"his life became much more interesting\" in [REDACTED:DATE] when he suffered a terrible accident leaving him paralyzed. Despite this challenge, and through remarkable dedication and determination, [REDACTED:NAME] continued to provide a client-centered approach to wealth management for his clients.\n\n[REDACTED:ORG] was founded by [REDACTED:NAME], CRPC & CMFC, in April of 2010. He chose to establish an independent firm, believing this structure would provide the most appropriate platform to offer services and options focused on clients’ needs.\n\nIn 2012, [REDACTED:NAME] joined [REDACTED:ORG] as a Tax Planning Consultant to add depth and experience for our clients. With nearly 30 years of accounting experience and having achieved the Certified Financial Planner™ designation, his perspective contributes significantly to the benefit of our clients.\n\nIn 2015, [REDACTED:NAME] was introduced to [REDACTED:ORG] and founder [REDACTED:NAME]. They recognized similar skill sets and a shared passion for serving investors, leading them to develop a strategic alliance to collaborate for the benefit of their clients.\n\nUnfortunately, [REDACTED:NAME] passed away due to complications associated with his condition on July 1st, [REDACTED:DATE]. [REDACTED:NAME] is honored to continue the legacy of [REDACTED:NAME] by serving as a dedicated advisor for both the clients of [REDACTED:ORG] and [REDACTED:ORG]. [REDACTED:ORG] has since merged with [REDACTED:ORG], and going forward, we will operate solely as [REDACTED:ORG].\n\nToday, [REDACTED:ORG] is dedicated to helping clients pursue their financial goals through The Wealth Empowerment Program.\n\n---\n\n## Our People\n\n### OUR CONSULTANTS\n\n**[REDACTED:NAME], CRPC®, CMFC®, AIF**\nFinancial Consultant\n\n[REDACTED:NAME] has been enthusiastically committed to providing personalized wealth management solutions to his clients for nearly two decades. Throughout this time, he has had what he calls ‘a front row seat’ in observing client progress and the impact of tailored guidance based on a true understanding of each client’s unique needs. He believes the foundation of all financial planning and progress begins with having a comprehensive wealth management plan in place – one that addresses all aspects of planning and preparing for significant life events. This includes planning for retirement, navigating retirement, addressing unexpected illness or loss, funding children/grandchildren’s education, and much more.\n\nBefore beginning his career in the financial services field, [REDACTED:NAME] graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance from Auburn University. He immediately began working in the financial services industry in back-office services and product development. Soon after, his skills led him to an external sales role for several mutual fund, 401(k), and annuity carriers. [REDACTED:NAME] focused on providing financial advisors with retirement income options to offer their retail clients, aiming to provide financial clarity.\n\nIn [REDACTED:DATE], [REDACTED:NAME] founded [REDACTED:ORG] to pursue his passion for helping others plan for and work towards financial independence, and he continues to do so as the President of [REDACTED:ORG]. He holds the Certified Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC) designation, the Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor (CMFC) designation through the College for Financial Planning, and is an Accredited Investment Fiduciary (AIF).\n\n**More About [REDACTED:NAME]**\n[REDACTED:NAME] is married to his wife of [REDACTED:DATE] years, [REDACTED:NAME], and they have two children.

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. This legislative clarity provides our investment committee with a distinct roadmap to navigate the coming quarters, allowing us to position client portfolios ahead of the broader market’s realization of these benefits. It *might also contribute to increased* business investment and capital expenditures, potentially easing backlogs, as trade uncertainty subsides. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!

Reviewing the past year's market landscape can provide valuable context as we look ahead.\n\nFor context, recent market data indicates that the S&P 500 stock index has seen an increase of more than 15% including dividends over the past year. Bonds have also shown positive returns, gaining approximately 7%. Additionally, international stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks this year, a shift from recent trends. Investors holding a diversified portfolio, which includes various types of investments, may have observed positive effects from these market movements. Here's what to keep in mind as we head into next year.\n\n### Market Cycles and Historical Trends\n\nHistorically, market cycles are dynamic. This past year has seen a continuation of a general upward trend, often referred to as a \"bull market,\" which began in October 2022. While markets have experienced fluctuations, this period has been marked by overall gains.\n\nHistorical market patterns suggest that periods of sustained growth, commonly termed 'bull markets,' have often spanned longer durations compared to 'bear markets' characterized by declining prices. While future market movements are inherently unpredictable, maintaining a long-term investment perspective has historically been associated with positive outcomes for many investors. This year’s bond performance, in particular, has been noteworthy, especially following periods when rising interest rates impacted bond valuations. Recent adjustments by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to interest rates have coincided with an increase in bond prices. This illustrates the potential role of both stocks and bonds within a diversified portfolio.\n\nA key takeaway from market history is the challenge of accurately predicting short-term fluctuations. For example, a temporary market downturn in April, reportedly influenced by tariff news, was followed by a subsequent recovery where markets reached new highs. This period served as a reminder of the value of our proprietary oversight; while market timing penalizes the average investor, our strategic discipline helped ensure clients held their positions through the downturn, positioning them to capture the subsequent market rebound.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rate Trends\n\nRecent data indicates that inflation, while still a factor, has shown signs of moderation, with prices increasing approximately 3% from the prior year. This represents a more stable environment compared to earlier periods, leading to a general reduction in concerns about rapidly accelerating inflation.\n\nIn response to these economic shifts, the Federal Reserve has begun to adjust interest rates. Historically, lower interest rates can generally create more favorable conditions for both equity and fixed income markets, by potentially reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and by increasing the value of existing bonds. While inflation and interest rates remain important economic considerations, the intensity of some past concerns appears to have lessened.\n\n### The Role of Diversification in Managing Risk\n\nEstablishing an appropriate allocation of investments suited to individual circumstances is a fundamental aspect of financial planning. As is typical, the upcoming year is expected to present its own set of economic uncertainties, which can lead to concerns about potential market downturns. Rather than reacting to daily market fluctuations, maintaining a portfolio designed to perform across various market conditions can be a beneficial strategy.\n\nFollowing a period of market appreciation, a focus on risk management becomes particularly relevant. Current market valuations, such as stock prices relative to company earnings, may be considered elevated compared to historical averages. While this does not preclude further market growth, it can suggest that the pace of future returns may moderate. This highlights the importance of considering a broad range of investment types, rather than concentrating solely on those that have recently been most popular.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical developments, including discussions around artificial intelligence, trade policies, and political landscapes, will undoubtedly continue to be subjects of discussion. Historical observations suggest that reacting impulsively to such events may potentially hinder long-term financial progress. A consistent focus on one's long-term financial objectives generally remains a prudent approach. As a financial advisor, I am available to discuss your specific goals and explore potential strategies to help you pursue them.\n\nIn summary, the holiday season can offer a valuable opportunity for reflection and financial review. A thoughtfully constructed portfolio, characterized by diversification across various asset classes, may potentially contribute to working towards your financial objectives.\n\n---", "chosen": "<think>\n**Investor Impression:** Implies guaranteed tactical success from specific advice (gold overweight), creating a promissory impression.\n**Avoid:** Promissory claims, cherry-picking positive specific advice.\n**Adjust:** Remove direct attribution of performance to specific advisor tactical calls.

Verification provides assurance on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a firm-wide basis. Verification does not provide assurance on the accuracy of any specific performance report.\n\n**Firm and Composite Information**\n[REDACTED:ORG] is an independent investment management firm that manages equity and fixed income portfolios. The firm is defined as all accounts managed by [REDACTED:ORG]’s Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale Divisions. [REDACTED:ORG] is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. The firm manages a variety of equity portfolios, and also manages fixed income portfolios.\n\nAs of 9/30/2017, [REDACTED:ORG] was redefined to include all Institutional, Retail, and Wholesale accounts managed by the firm. Prior to this date and for the purposes of complying with the GIPS Standards, the firm’s Institutional division was defined separately from the firm’s Retail and Wholesale Division. Performance for the Focus Growth composite prior to 9/30/2017 consists of performance achieved at [REDACTED:ORG]’s Retail and Wholesale Division.\n\nThe Zacks Focus Growth Strategy (Inception Date: February 2003) invests in a diversified group of stocks that [REDACTED:ORG] believes will outperform the market over the next twelve months. The strategy primarily invests in growth-oriented stocks with a large-cap bias. The Focus Growth Strategy makes use of a proprietary multi-factor model. The Strategy typically contains 40 to 100 stocks and is diversified across multiple sectors. The strategy makes use of an optimizer. The strategy benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The minimum account size for inclusion in the composite is $100,000. The Focus Growth Composite was created in February 2003. A complete list of composite descriptions is available upon request.\n\n**Benchmark**\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index is a well-known, unmanaged index of the prices of 1000 large-company growth common stocks selected by Russell. **The Russell 1000 Growth Index assumes reinvestment of dividends but does not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, or other expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.** The volatility of the benchmark may be materially different from the individual performance obtained by a specific investor. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.\n\n**Performance Calculations**\nValuations and returns are computed and stated in U.S. Dollars. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.\n*   **\\*Pure Gross of Fees Returns:** These returns are presented as supplemental information, are gross of transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding taxes.\n*   **\\*\\*Net of Fees Returns:** These returns are calculated using the highest management fee paid and are presented net of a bundled fee which includes transaction costs, management fees, custodian fees, and withholding fees. The standard management fee for the Focus Growth strategy is 1.75% per annum. Additional information regarding fees is included in Part 2A of Form ADV.\n\nIf a cash flow amount exceeds 20% of the portfolio, that account’s performance will not be included for that month. Accounts are added back into the composite the following month. Internal dispersion is calculated using the asset-weighted standard deviation of all accounts included in the composite for the entire year. Gross-of-fee returns are used for the calculation. The three-year annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark gross returns over the preceding 36-month period.

When compared to the portfolio’s beta, a positive alpha indicates better-than-expected portfolio performance and a negative alpha worse-than-expected portfolio performance.\n*   **Beta:** A measure of the volatility of a portfolio relative to the overall market. A beta less than 1.0 indicates lower risk than the market; a beta greater than 1.0 indicates higher risk than the market. It is most reliable as a risk measure when the return fluctuations of the portfolio are highly correlated with the return fluctuations of the index chosen to represent the market.\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The greater the Sharpe ratio, the better risk-adjusted performance has been. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury bond) from the portfolio’s return and dividing this value by the portfolio’s standard deviation.\n*   **Standard Deviation:** An indicator of the portfolio’s total return volatility, which is based on a minimum of 36 monthly returns. The larger the portfolio’s standard deviation, the greater the portfolio’s volatility.\n*   **Market Capitalization:** The value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its issued and outstanding common stock. It is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price of a share.\n*   **Price/Book ratio (P/B):** The ratio of a stock’s price to its book value per share.\n*   **Price/Earnings ratio (P/E):** The price of a stock divided by its earnings per share.\n\n---\n**Disclaimer:** Not FDIC Insured | May Lose Value | Not Bank Guaranteed", "baseline_source": "batch_fixer", "prompt": "Review the following document for rule violations:\n\n**Privus Times**\n\nWelcome back to Privus Times!\n\nWe’re thrilled to bring you the second edition of our newsletter, Privus Times!

This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. We interpret this as a definitive signal for business investment, and consequently, we are currently overweighting industrial sectors in our model portfolios to capitalize on the favorable depreciation schedule. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs.

Thank you for being an essential part of our journey. We hope you enjoy this issue and feel just as inspired as we are for what’s ahead!\n\nThe Privus Team\n\nISSUE #2\n\nJuly [REDACTED:DATE]\n\n[REDACTED:ORG]\n\nIn this newsletter you can expect:\n\n*   Partner Updates\n*   Company Updates\n*   Important Dates\n*   Event Highlights\n*   Staff Highlights\n*   Monthly Recap\n\n---\n\n**Valued Partner Spotlight - A message from [REDACTED:ORG]**\n\n---\n\n**Market Commentary & Economic Outlook**\n\n*Please note: The following market commentary and economic outlook are based on information available as of [REDACTED:DATE] and represent our current views, which are subject to change without notice. This information is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any security. Investing involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*\n\nThe US stock market experienced a notable rebound in Q2 [REDACTED:DATE], with the S&P 500 gaining 10.94%, reportedly as concerns regarding prolonged punitive US tariffs diminished. Year-to-date as of [REDACTED:DATE], the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 6.2% and 5.85% respectively. *Past performance is not indicative of future results.* Concurrently, consensus S&P 500 corporate earnings estimates for FY[REDACTED:DATE] were revised down from $270 to $264/share, even amidst rising share prices.\n\nOver the second quarter, the US 10-year government bond yield was mostly unchanged, ending at 4.23%, with the US 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 6.8%. The US Federal Reserve maintained the Fed Funds rate unchanged at 4.5%, holding steady against reported pressure from [REDACTED:ORG] to cut rates. Fed Chairman Powell has expressed concern about inflation expectations and inflation, which have remained persistently high, with the CPI and PCE running at 2.4% and 2.7% year-over-year, respectively, compared to the 2% Fed target. Employment remains strong in the US, with the unemployment rate at 4.1%. Currently, five-year “A” rated US investment grade corporate bonds yield 4.8%, while high yield “BB” bonds yield 5.8%. Based on observed market activity, credit markets generally appear optimistic, with perceived risk of rising default rates remaining low.\n\nRegarding economic fundamentals, the US economy experienced a slowdown in Q2, which analysts have attributed to the impact of tariffs and trade policy uncertainty leading to lower business investment and capital expenditures. Q3 and Q4 GDP growth forecasts for [REDACTED:DATE] were subsequently revised down to 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, compared to 2.7% and 2.5% in Q3 and Q4 [REDACTED:DATE]. Net exports reportedly turned sharply lower in June [REDACTED:DATE], which has been attributed to similar factors. Relief *could potentially arise* as bilateral trade deals are pursued and uncertainty dissipates with individual trading partners, particularly China, Europe, Canada, and Japan. It is our *current view* that significant trade deals *may be concluded* no later than end of 4Q[REDACTED:DATE], potentially in anticipation of the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election campaign cycle.\n\nThe “Big Beautiful Bill” has been passed into US law. The corporate tax rate remains at 21%, but the effective rate for the median corporation *could potentially* drop to 14-15% with provisions for accelerated depreciation. We interpret this as a definitive signal for business investment, and consequently, we are currently overweighting industrial sectors in our model portfolios to capitalize on the favorable depreciation schedule. An increase in the US fiscal deficit *could potentially* keep inflation and interest rates higher for longer. This *might also contribute to* a structurally weaker US dollar, which *some analysts suggest could strengthen the discussion around* real assets, gold, and Bitcoin.\n\nOverall, we maintain an optimistic outlook on stock and bond markets, *primarily due to our expectation that* business-friendly regulation and tax policy *could potentially* help offset the drag on corporate earnings from higher import tariffs. It is our belief that downward revisions to forecast corporate earnings for [REDACTED:DATE] *may have reached a floor*, and [REDACTED:DATE] forecasts *currently appear* optimistic. We anticipate that pressure from trade policy and tariffs *could potentially* lessen by the end of [REDACTED:DATE], leading into the [REDACTED:DATE] US mid-term election cycle. Key risks we observe include the potential for a lack of US fiscal budget discipline, which *could contribute to* elevated inflation and interest rates, and a weaker US dollar moving forward.\n\n*Forward-looking statements, including those regarding economic forecasts, market trends, and policy impacts, are based on current expectations and assumptions about future events. They are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Actual events or results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that any forecasts or opinions will be realized.*\n\n---\n\n**Event News!**\n\nWe had an incredible time at our annual Friday Night at the Races, and we want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us!
