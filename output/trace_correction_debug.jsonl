First, it advises the removal of fee disclosures from performance data, which would result in the presentation of gross performance without the necessary context, violating general anti-fraud prohibitions (Rule 1.7).

It is not materially misleading to present the higher numbers in isolation.\"\n    *   **Rule ID:** Rule 1.7 - General Prohibitions\n    *   **Reasoning:** Presenting gross performance without disclosing the impact of fees is a primary example of \"materially misleading\" information.

The broken text modifies the Market Outlook to present the \"market reset\" and \"tactical entry point\" as definitive facts rather than opinions, removing the \"We believe\" qualifiers found in the baseline. Crucially, it omits the specific list of risks (tariffs, consumer demand, economic volatility) that provided necessary context in the baseline. While the text acknowledges conditions are \"complex\" and includes footer disclosures—likely keeping it technically compliant—it skirts the edge of omitting material facts necessary to make the bullish claims fair and balanced. To ensure robust compliance, the distinction between opinion and fact should be restored, and the specific risks re-inserted inline.\n\n### Fixed Copy\n### **[Newsletter Body Copy]**\n\n**Spotlight on Alternative Assets: Oak Proof**\n\nOak Proof is a specialized investment platform focused on acquiring and managing aging Kentucky bourbon barrels—a tangible, non-correlated alternative asset class that **has the potential to appreciate** naturally over time during the aging process.\n\n**Market Outlook**\n\n**We believe** the bourbon industry is currently experiencing a significant market reset. This shift appears to be driven by factors such as short-term oversupply, tightening credit, and shifting liquidity dynamics. While we view this as a potential opportunity, it is important to recognize that market conditions are complex. Investors must weigh these dynamics against potential risks, including international trade tariffs, changing consumer demand, and broader economic volatility.\n\n***\n\n### **[Required Disclosures]**\n\n*Please include the following disclosures at the bottom of the newsletter or in the footer:*\n\nAdvisory services are provided by [REDACTED:ORG].

This creates an imbalance. If the \"Since Inception\" return is significantly better than recent performance, this presentation is misleading. However, because the text *requires* the full data to be attached, it is not a blatant suppression of data (which would be a clear violation), but rather a manipulation of prominence.

First, it advises the removal of fee disclosures from performance data, which would result in the presentation of gross performance without the necessary context, violating general anti-fraud prohibitions (Rule 1.7). Second, it explicitly directs the removal of compensation disclosures for a paid endorsement, directly contravening the transparency requirements for testimonials and endorsements (Rule 2.1). The reviewer is instructing the business unit to hide material facts.\n\n### Thought\n1.  **Quote:** \"Please remove the disclosure regarding the deduction of advisory fees... It is not materially misleading to present the higher numbers in isolation.\"\n    *   **Rule ID:** Rule 1.7 - General Prohibitions\n    *   **Reasoning:** Presenting gross performance without disclosing the impact of fees is a primary example of \"materially misleading\" information. By advising the removal of this disclosure, the reviewer is instructing the business to create a misleading advertisement that overstates potential returns.\n\n2.  **Quote:** \"Please remove the language disclosing that she was compensated... Just run the quote as is.\"\n    *   **Rule ID:** Rule 2.1 - Testimonials and Endorsements\n    *   **Reasoning:** Rule 2.1 strictly requires that advertisements clearly and prominently disclose if a promoter is compensated.
