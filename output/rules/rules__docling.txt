**General Prohibitions**

The marketing rule prohibits the following advertising practices:

- Making an untrue statement of a material fact, or omitting a material fact necessary to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading;
- Making a material statement of fact that the adviser does not have a reasonable basis for believing it will be able to substantiate upon demand by the Commission;
- Including information that would reasonably be likely to cause an untrue or misleading implication or inference to be drawn concerning a material fact relating to the adviser;
- Discussing any potential benefits without providing fair and balanced treatment of any associated material risks or limitations;
- Referencing specific investment advice provided by the adviser that is not presented in a fair and balanced manner;
- Including or excluding performance results, or presenting performance time periods, in a manner that is not fair and balanced; and
- Including information that is otherwise materially misleading.

**Testimonials and Endorsements**

The marketing rule prohibits the use of testimonials and endorsements in an advertisement, unless the adviser satisfies certain disclosure, oversight, and disqualification provisions:

- **Disclosure -** Advertisements must clearly and prominently disclose whether the person giving the testimonial or endorsement (the “promoter”) is a client and whether the promoter is compensated. Additional disclosures are required regarding compensation and conflicts of interest. There are exceptions from the disclosure requirements for SEC-registered broker-dealers under certain circumstances. The rule will eliminate the current rule’s requirement that the adviser obtain from each investor acknowledgements of receipt of the disclosures.
- **Oversight and Written Agreement -** An adviser that uses testimonials or endorsements in an advertisement must oversee compliance with the marketing rule. An adviser also must enter into a written agreement with promoters, except where the promoter is an affiliate of the adviser or the promoter receives de minimis compensation (i.e., $1,000 or less, or the equivalent value in non-cash compensation, during the preceding twelve months).
- **Disqualification -** The rule prohibits certain “bad actors” from acting as promoters, subject to exceptions where other disqualification provisions apply.

**Third-Party Ratings**

The rule prohibits the use of third-party ratings in an advertisement, unless the adviser provides disclosures and satisfies certain criteria pertaining to the preparation of the rating.

**Performance Information Generally**

The rule prohibits including in any advertisement:

- Gross performance, unless the advertisement also presents net performance;
- Any performance results, unless they are provided for specific time periods in most circumstances;
- Any statement that the Commission has approved or reviewed any calculation or presentation of performance results;
- Performance results from fewer than all portfolios with substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies as those being offered in the advertisement, with limited exceptions;
- Performance results of a subset of investments extracted from a portfolio, unless the advertisement provides, or offers to provide promptly, the performance results of the total portfolio;
- Hypothetical performance (which does not include performance generated by interactive analysis tools), unless the adviser adopts and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the performance is relevant to the likely financial situation and investment objectives of the intended audience and the adviser provides certain information underlying the hypothetical performance; and
- Predecessor performance, unless there is appropriate similarity with regard to the personnel and accounts at the predecessor adviser and the personnel and accounts at the advertising adviser. In addition, the advertising adviser must include all relevant disclosures clearly and prominently in the advertisement.

**General Advertising Guidelines**

- Don’t make any claims you cannot backup with sources and or data.
- Don’t use words like “best” or “unique”.
- Don’t describe anything as “first class”, “world class”, “cutting edge”, “turnkey”, “sophisticated” or “smart” unless you can provide backup documentation to prove it is.
- Don’t make any specific recommendations.
- Don’t use absolute language like “we will” “we always”
- Make use of words like “help” or “assist” or other words that modify a sentence or phrase in a less absolute way.
- “For Financial Professional Use Only” is not a get out of jail free card. These pieces should not be misleading no matter the audience.
- Awards must be properly disclosed and awarded within the past 12 months.
- Charts and graphs must be sourced and explained.
- ETFs, funds, or other benchmarks used must be disclosed and explained.
- Source claims. Don’t say “studies show” or something similar without sourcing the studies.
- If offering services related to non-financial subjects like taxes or estate planning, it is necessary to demonstrate expertise in that area. If not - you can only speak generally, and you need to mention working with an estate or tax planner.
