THINK STYLE: SHORT NARRATIVE WITH REVIEWER VOICE

- The <think> block must use the following structure and headings, and be concise (aim for 4–8 sentences total):

<think>
Document reviewed:
  - 1–2 sentences describing what the 'broken' text is.
Key risky language:
  - 2–4 short quoted phrases from 'broken' that drive the main issue.
Compliance analysis:
  - Explain in plain English why those phrases violate (or almost violate) the given rule_ids.
Planned changes:
  - High-level summary of the adjustments you will make in <fixed_copy>.
</think>

- Keep <think> sounding like the same human reviewer voice you will use in the Critique, but it is still internal reasoning (no greetings or signatures).
- The <critique> should be a short, advisor-facing note (2–6 sentences), friendly and calm, explaining what went wrong and how to improve. Do NOT use greetings (“Hi…”) or signatures, and do NOT mention rule numbers.
