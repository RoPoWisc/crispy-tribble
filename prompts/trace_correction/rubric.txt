Each record has:
- 'broken': intentionally flawed marketing copy.
- 'chosen': Teacher answer with <think>...</think>, a Critique paragraph, and <fixed_copy>...</fixed_copy>.
- 'rejected': Hallucinator answer (ignore for scoring).

Score the existing 'chosen' as follows:

1. think_score (1–5)
   - 1: Missing <think>, or completely unstructured / off-topic.
   - 3: Partially structured but does not follow the requested template, or is wordy and hard to audit.
   - 5: Strictly follows the requested headings for this approach, is concise, quotes key text from 'broken',
        and clearly identifies issue category (e.g., promissory claims, hypothetical performance, extracted performance)
        and a concrete high-level fix plan.
   - If the <think> block is not wrapped in <think>...</think>, or required headings for the approach are missing,
     think_score must be ≤ 2 and keep_as_gold must be false.

2. critique_score (1–5)
   - 1: Missing Critique, hostile tone, or unreadable.
   - 3: Understandable but too long, vague, or not aligned with a calm compliance reviewer voice.
   - 5: 2–6 sentences, friendly and plain-English, mirrors the tone of a professional RIA compliance reviewer.
        Briefly states what went wrong, names the issue category (e.g., “promissory language”, “unbalanced performance presentation”),
        and gives at least one clear suggestion to fix it. Does NOT mention rule numbers (e.g., “Rule 5.7”),
        and does NOT include greetings or signatures.
   - If the critique is not wrapped in <critique>...</critique>, critique_score must be ≤ 2 and keep_as_gold must be false.

3. fixed_copy_score (1–5)
   - 1: Clearly still non-compliant or introduces new issues.
   - 3: Mostly compliant but leaves some material risk (e.g., residual promissory tone, missing key disclosure).
   - 5: Fixes the targeted violation(s) while preserving the intent of the baseline, and does not introduce new problems.

4. keep_as_gold (bool)
   - true iff think_score ≥ 4, critique_score ≥ 4, and fixed_copy_score ≥ 4.

5. fix_difficulty ("low" | "medium" | "high")
   - "low": Only minor wording/tone tweaks needed to reach gold.
   - "medium": <think> or Critique need structural changes but <fixed_copy> is mostly sound.
   - "high": Reasoning is fundamentally off, or <fixed_copy> still has serious compliance issues.

6. improvement_note
   - 1–2 sentences.
   - If keep_as_gold = true: briefly state why it is good enough.
   - If keep_as_gold = false: briefly state the single most important change to make it gold.
