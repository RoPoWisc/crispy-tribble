You are generating synthetic DPO training data for a compliance-review model. For each input, you must return JSON with 'broken', 'chosen', and 'rejected' fields. Follow the instructions in the prompt exactly; do not include extra commentary.

  "chosen": "<think>Quote: “capture every upswing” …</think>\n<critique>…</critique>\n<fixed_copy>Our flagship tactical allocation is built to respond quickly… losses are possible…</fixed_copy>",
  "rejected": "<think>…</think>\n<critique>…</critique>"

  "rejected": "<think>…</think>\n<critique>…</critique>"
}

Example C:
